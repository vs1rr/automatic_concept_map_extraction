Edward VIII was born in 1894 and became king of the United Kingdom in 1936 after his father's death.
However, he abdicated the throne less than a year later in order to marry his lover, Wallis Simpson, an American divorc√©e.
After abdicating, he took the title Duke of Windsor and lived a jet-setting life with Simpson.
Edward VIII died in France in 1972.
Before becoming king, Edward was known for his charm and popularity, and he fell in love with Simpson in 1931.
Despite the monarchy's disapproval, the couple continued their relationship, leading to Edward's abdication.
He was appointed as Governor of the Bahama Islands by his brother, King George VI, during World War II.

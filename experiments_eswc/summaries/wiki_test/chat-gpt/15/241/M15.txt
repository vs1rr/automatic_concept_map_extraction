The Ilkhanate was one of the four khanates within the Mongol Empire, centered in Persia and including present-day Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other regions.
The dynasty was founded by Hulegu, Genghis Khan's grandson, who conquered Muslim kingdoms to the west and ended the Abbasid caliphate in 1258.
The Ilkhans adopted Islam and oversaw a Renaissance in Iran, but faced challenges from the Mamluks and other Mongol khanates.
They engaged in alliances with Christian states in the Levant, but ultimately failed to establish a lasting Franco-Mongol alliance.
The Ilkhanate rulers converted to Buddhism and later Islam, with varying policies towards religious minorities.
After the death of Abu Sa'id in 1335, the Ilkhanate rapidly disintegrated into rival successor states, with the Jalayirids becoming a major power in Iran.
Post-Ilkhanate rulers emerged in various regions, leading to further fragmentation.
The Ilkhanate's influence declined, and Timur later attempted to restore the old khanate.
The historian Rashid al-Din provided valuable historical information about the Ilkhanate rulers.
Despite attempts at alliances and conversions, the Ilkhanate faced internal and external challenges that ultimately led to its disintegration and the rise of new regional powers in Iran.

The 1200s started out positively for the Islamic world, with victories over the Crusaders and the removal of the Ismaili Fatimids.
However, the rise of the ruthless Mongols, led by Genghis Khan, would soon bring destruction and devastation to Southwest Asia.
Genghis Khan used terror as a weapon of war, leading to the massacre of millions in cities like Herat.
Under his successor, Ogedei, the Muslim world was spared Mongol wrath until Genghis Khan's grandson, Möngke, resolved to extend Mongol rule to the Middle East.
In 1258, Hulagu, Möngke's brother, led a Mongol horde to Mesopotamia, with the goal of destroying Islam.
Baghdad, once a center of Islamic culture and learning, was left in ruins, with countless lives lost and the destruction of priceless knowledge.
The Mongols, with the help of Christian allies, continued their campaign, conquering Muslim Syria and weakening the Ayyubid Dynasty.
However, their reign of terror came to an end in 1260 at the Battle of Ayn Jalut, where the Mamluks defeated the Mongols, marking a turning point in Mongol conquests.
The defeat of the Mongols by the Mamluks prevented further invasions of the Holy Lands and ensured the survival of the Mamluk Sultanate.
The Mongol Empire, already weakened by internal conflicts and alliances with European powers, began to decline, with Berke Khan, a Muslim convert, leading raids against Hulagu's territories.
The Mongol legacy in the Muslim world was one of death, destruction, and lasting scars, highlighting the importance of unity in the face of external threats.

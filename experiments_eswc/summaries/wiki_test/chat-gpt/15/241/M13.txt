Arghun Khan, the fourth ruler of the Mongol empire's Ilkhanate, reigned from 1284 to 1291.
He was a devout Buddhist who sent embassies to Europe in an attempt to form a Franco-Mongol alliance against Muslims in the Holy Land.
Arghun requested a new bride from his great-uncle Kublai Khan, with Marco Polo reportedly escorting her.
Arghun had multiple wives and his sons Ghazan and Öljeitü eventually succeeded him and converted to Islam.
He showed tolerance for all faiths, even allowing Muslims to be judged under Koranic law.
Arghun's reign was relatively peaceful, with few conflicts with other Mongols, although he did fight against the Chagatai Khanate and the Golden Horde.
He sought alliances with European powers to fight the Mamluks in the Middle East, but these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
Arghun died in 1291 and was succeeded by his brother Gaykhatu.
Despite his efforts, the Mongol alliance with the West did not materialize, and the Mamluks continued to strengthen their power in Syria.
Arghun's death marked the end of his attempts at combined action with the West.
His legacy lived on in the West, with many children in Italy being named after Mongol rulers like Arghun

Hulagu Khan, also known as Hulagu, was a Mongol ruler who conquered much of Southwest Asia.
He was the grandson of Genghis Khan and the brother of Arik Boke, Mongke, and Kublai Khan.
Under Hulagu's leadership, the Mongols destroyed Baghdad and weakened Damascus, shifting Islamic influence to the Mamluks in Cairo.
His dynasty unified much of Iran and oversaw an Iranian Renaissance.
Hulagu's military campaigns included the conquest of the Lurs, the destruction of the Hashshashin sect, and the submission or destruction of various Muslim states.
He also attempted to form an alliance with Europe against the Muslims but was unsuccessful.
Hulagu's legacy includes laying the foundations of the Ilkhanate State, opening Iran to influences from Europe and China, and contributing to East-West cultural exchange.
He died in 1265 and was succeeded by his son Abaqa.
His rule is usually dated from 1256 to 1353, and his dynasty brought stability to the region for about a century.

The Hasmonean dynasty was a ruling dynasty in Judea and surrounding regions during Classical antiquity.
Established under the leadership of Simon Maccabaeus, the dynasty ruled semi-autonomously from the Seleucids before becoming fully independent in 110 BC.
The dynasty expanded into neighboring regions and took the title "basileus," with some modern scholars referring to this period as an independent kingdom of Israel.
The kingdom was eventually conquered by the Roman Republic in 63 BC, leading to the end of the Hasmonean dynasty.
The dynasty faced internal conflicts, civil wars, and external threats from the Romans and Parthians.
The legacy of the Hasmonean dynasty includes Jewish nationalism, desire for independence, and contributions to Jewish religious scholarship.
The dynasty's downfall was attributed to dynastic quarrels, Hellenization, and claims to kingship that were not in line with Jewish tradition.
The Hasmonean leaders included notable figures such as Mattathias, Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan Maccabeus, Simon Maccabeus, and others.
The dynasty's rule marked a significant period in Jewish history, leading to the eventual dispersion of the Jewish population after the Roman conquest.

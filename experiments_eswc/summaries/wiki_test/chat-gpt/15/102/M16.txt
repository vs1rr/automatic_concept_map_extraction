The Acra fortress in Jerusalem was built by the Seleucid King Antiochus IV in 168-7 BCE to oppress the Jews and enforce his rule.
It was located in the City of David and served as a stronghold for the Seleucid garrison.
The fortress remained standing despite multiple attempts by the Jews to capture it during the Maccabean Revolt.
It was eventually captured by Simon Maccabeus around 141 BCE.
Recent excavations have uncovered evidence of the Acra

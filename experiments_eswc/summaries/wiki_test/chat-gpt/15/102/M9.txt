Simon Maccabeus was a Hasmonean prince and high priest who played a significant role in the war of liberation against the Syrians.
He was praised by his father for his counsel and proved to be sagacious and circumspect.
Simon took on leadership roles, such as being appointed strategus by Antiochus VI, and later becoming the leader of the Jewish people after the capture of his brother Jonathan.
He secured Judea's independence from Syria, minted coins, and led successful military campaigns.
Simon also established peace, formed alliances with Rome, and was appointed high priest, strategus, and ethnarch of the Jews.
He bequeathed his titles to his children, founding the Hasmonean dynasty.
However, his reign was marred by a war with Antiochus VII, which ultimately led to his violent death in 135 B.C.
Simon's legacy paved the way for the events of the following century, and he was succeeded by his son John Hyrcanus I. Despite his short reign, Simon Maccabeus left a lasting impact on the Jewish people and their struggle for independence.

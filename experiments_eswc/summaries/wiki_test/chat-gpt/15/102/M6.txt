Recent archaeological excavations in the City of David National Park have uncovered evidence of the long-lost Acra, a fortified compound built by Antiochus Epiphanes in Jerusalem in 168 BCE.
The discovery includes a massive wall, a tower, and defensive elements, as well as artifacts such as lead sling stones and bronze arrowheads.

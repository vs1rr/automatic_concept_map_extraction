President William McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901 by anarchist Leon Czolgosz at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.
Despite initial signs of recovery, McKinley died on September 14 from his wounds.
Seven little-known facts surrounding his assassination include the coincidence that all four presidents who were shot to death were shot on a Friday, the mystery of the bullet that caused his death, and the extreme reactions towards those who spoke out against McKinley or in support of his assassin.
Czolgosz's trial lasted just over 8 hours, and he was sentenced to death and executed by electrocution on October 29, 1901.
After his execution, Czolgosz's body was destroyed to prevent relic hunters from disturbing his grave.
Following McKinley's funeral in Canton, Ohio, New York City came to a standstill in a moment of silence.
There was also a proposal to rename the Philippine Islands after McKinley, known as the McKinley Islands, to honor his legacy and the expansion of the United States' influence to the Orient during his administration.
The proposal aimed to link McKinley's name with the government of the country for all time and to Americanize the islands by naming them after distinguished Americans.

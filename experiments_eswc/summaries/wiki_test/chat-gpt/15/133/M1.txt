Cloud Gate, also known as "The Bean," is a famous public sculpture in Chicago's Millennium Park.
Designed by artist Anish Kapoor, the stainless steel structure consists of 168 plates seamlessly welded together.
Despite initial criticism due to being unfinished, Cloud Gate became a beloved symbol of the city after its completion in 2006.

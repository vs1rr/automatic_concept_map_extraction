Xavier Mertz was a Swiss explorer who took part in the Far Eastern Party of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, led by Douglas Mawson.
Mertz was an accomplished skier and mountaineer, and was hired as a ski instructor for the expedition.
During the journey, Mertz and his companion, Belgrave Ninnis, encountered a tragic accident that led to Ninnis's death.
Mertz himself fell ill and eventually died on January 7, 1913.
Mawson buried him and continued on to the expedition's main base, narrowly missing the ship that could have taken him home.

Douglas Mawson led the Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1912, exploring uncharted territory in Antarctica.
Mawson, along with two companions, faced extreme conditions, including fierce winds and hidden crevasses.
Tragedy struck when one of the men, Ninnis, fell into a crevasse, resulting in his death and the loss of valuable supplies.
Mawson and his remaining companion, Mertz, struggled to survive, resorting to eating their sled dogs and battling frostbite and exhaustion.
Mertz eventually succumbed to his injuries, leaving Mawson alone to continue the journey back to their base camp.
Mawson faced numerous challenges, including falling into a crevasse and nearly giving up hope.
However, he persevered, using his knife to fashion a makeshift sail and pushing himself to the brink of exhaustion.
Despite missing the relief ship, Mawson eventually made it back to the base camp, where he was greeted as a hero.
Mawson's determination and survival skills made him a national hero in Australia, and he went on to lead more expeditions and contribute valuable scientific research to the field of polar exploration.
His legacy lives on as one of the greatest explorers of all time.

Sir Douglas Mawson was an Australian geologist, Antarctic explorer, and academic who played a key role in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.
Born in 1882 in Shipley, West Yorkshire, Mawson emigrated to Australia at a young age and graduated from the University of Sydney in 1902.
He was appointed geologist to an expedition to the New Hebrides in 1903 and later became a lecturer at the University of Adelaide.


Mawson joined Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition in 1907 and later led the Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911.
During this expedition, Mawson and his team faced extreme conditions, including harsh winds and the loss of supplies in a crevasse.
Mawson's companion, Mertz, died from consuming high levels of vitamin A found in Husky liver, while Mawson barely survived a fall into a crevasse.


After his Antarctic expeditions, Mawson continued his academic and exploration work, leading expeditions to the Antarctic in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
He also conducted geological research in South Australia and was made Emeritus Professor of the University of Adelaide upon his retirement in 1952.
Mawson passed away in 1958 from a cerebral hemorrhage.


Mawson's legacy includes having his image on Australian currency, as well as various geographical features and buildings named in his honor.
His collection of Antarctic exploration artifacts is displayed at the South Australian Museum, and his expeditions have been the subject of books, operas, and expeditions in his honor.
Despite his achievements, some historians have questioned Mawson's navigation, risk-taking, and leadership during his expeditions.
Mawson's burial took place at Saint Jude's Anglican Church

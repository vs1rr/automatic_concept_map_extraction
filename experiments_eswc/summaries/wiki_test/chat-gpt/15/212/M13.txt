British Prime Minister Spencer Perceval was assassinated on 11 May 1812 by John Bellingham, a Liverpool businessman, in the lobby of the House of Commons.
Perceval was the only British Prime Minister to have been assassinated.
Bellingham had sought redress for his grievances against the government but was repeatedly ignored, leading him to believe that shooting the Prime Minister was his only option to get justice.
Bellingham was found guilty of murder and hanged in public.
The assassination sparked theories of a possible conspiracy, but no evidence was found to support this.
Perceval was buried in a private funeral, leaving behind his widow and twelve children.
Parliament settled a sum of money on his family and agreed to erect a monument in his honor.
Perceval's widow later remarried and died in 1844.
The assassination had political implications even centuries later, with a descendant of Bellingham and a descendant of Perceval running against each other in a local election in 1997.
The election was seen as a conflict between the descendants of the two historical figures.
Henry Bellingham, the descendant of Bellingham, was re-elected in 2001 and remains the MP for North West Norfolk.
The assassination of Spencer Perceval remains a significant event in British history, with its impact still felt in modern politics.

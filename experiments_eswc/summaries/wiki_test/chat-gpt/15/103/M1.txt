Angkor is an ancient archaeological site in Cambodia that was the capital of the Khmer empire from the 9th to the 15th century.
The city was a center of administration and worship, with temples built to glorify the kings and gods.
The city was planned based on Indian cosmology, with temples symbolizing Mount Meru and the cosmos.
The city thrived until it was captured and sacked by the armies of Ayutthaya in 1431, leading to its partial abandonment.
The temples at Angkor, including Angkor Wat, were built to ensure the immortality of the kings through religious cults.
In the late 13th century, the city was still thriving, but by the 16th century, it was abandoned and covered by jungle.
In the 19th century, French archaeologists began a comprehensive research and restoration program at Angkor.
In 1992, Angkor was designated a World Heritage site, and preservation efforts have been ongoing to protect the site from environmental degradation and neglect.

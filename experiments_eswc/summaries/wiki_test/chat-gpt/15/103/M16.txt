Angkor Wat Temple in Cambodia was built by the Khmer empire in the 12th century to honor Vishnu.
The temple complex covers a large area with various structures, including libraries, pools, and galleries.
The entrance faces west, unlike other Khmer temples, and the inner walls are decorated with bas reliefs.
The central tower of the temple is 65 meters tall.
Many Buddha statues were destroyed during the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s.

Angkor in Cambodia is home to the largest temple building from ancient times, Angkor Wat.
However, it is much more than just one temple, as it is the vastest archaeological zone and a top tourist destination.
With impressive stone structures, beautiful surroundings, and a rich history, Angkor is a must-visit for sightseeing enthusiasts.
The ancient town was once larger than present-day New York, with over 700,000 inhabitants.

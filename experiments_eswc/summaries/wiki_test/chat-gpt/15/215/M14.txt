American traitor Benedict Arnold demonstrated his military ability during an epic march through the Maine wilderness in 1775.
Despite being ill-supplied, Arnold's force of 1100 men was reduced to 600 starving soldiers by the time they reached Quebec.
Arnold miraculously completed the march and sent a report to General Washington on November 8, 1775.
Arnold described the challenges faced during the march, including losing provisions and staving batteaus.
He also mentioned the arrival of British reinforcements in Quebec and his plans to cut off their communication with the country.
Future posts will discuss Montgomery's progress towards Quebec and the attempted storming of Quebec by Montgomery and Arnold.
Additionally, John Stark, a prominent American combat commander, was praised for his bravery during the Battle of Bennington and his role in saving his younger brother from an Abenaki Indian war party.
Stark's resignation from the Continental army and his famous phrase "live free or die" were also highlighted.

The Arnold Expedition took place from September to November 1775 during the American Revolution.
Led by Colonel Benedict Arnold, the expedition aimed to invade Canada with the support of the French-speaking population.
Despite initial reluctance from Congress, Major General Philip Schuyler was directed to advance north via the Lake Champlain-Richelieu River corridor.
Arnold proposed a second invasion force via Maine's Kennebec River, Lake Mégantic, and Chaudière River, which was approved by General George Washington.
The expedition faced numerous challenges, including delays, leaks in the bateaux, and lack of provisions.
Despite these difficulties, Arnold and his men reached Quebec City in November.
However, they were unable to capture the city and were forced to retreat following heavy losses in the Battle of Quebec.
The invasion of Canada ultimately ended in failure, with the Americans retreating back into New York after being defeated at Trois-Rivières in June 1776.

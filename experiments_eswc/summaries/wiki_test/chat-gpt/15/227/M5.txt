The Texas Revolution began in October 1835 with the Battle of Gonzales and ended in April 1836 with the Battle of San Jacinto.
The revolution was fueled by social and political differences between Mexican rulers and Anglo-American occupants of Texas.
Military incidents in 1826, 1832, and 1835 led to clashes between official forces and colonists.
The colonists sought privileges and reforms, including extension of tariff exemptions, separation from Coahuila, and repeal of the Law of April 6, 1830.
Santa Anna's movements towards dictatorship and military occupation of Texas further fueled the revolution.
The Battle of Gonzales marked the first shot in the revolution, leading to a series of battles including the Battle of Concepci√≥n and the Grass Fight.
The climax came with the siege of Bexar, where the Texans captured San Antonio.
Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande with a large force to crush the insurgency in Texas.
The Convention of 1836 declared independence on March 2, appointing Sam Houston as commander of the Texas army.
Santa Anna's target was San Antonio, but Goliad was strategically more important.
The Alamo, defended by a small force under Bowie and Travis, was also a key point.
Despite being outnumbered, the Texans were determined to fight for their independence.
The revolution culminated in the decisive Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, where the Texan forces under Houston defeated Santa Anna's army, securing Texas' independence.

On September 11, 1842, Mexican General Adri√°n Woll led a force of 1,200 men to capture San Antonio, Texas.
This event was part of ongoing skirmishes between Texas and Mexico following the Texas Revolution.
Woll's army was repulsed by Texan troops in the battle of Salado Creek on September 18, leading to his retreat back to Mexico.
Woll had a long military career, serving in various roles in the Mexican army and participating in conflicts such as the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War of Independence.
After the Texas Revolution, Woll played a minor role in Mexican affairs and was eventually arrested and imprisoned during a revolt against Santa Anna.
He was later freed and continued to serve in various military capacities until his death in 1875.
The Battle of Salado Creek and the Dawson Massacre were significant events during the Mexican invasions of 1842, where Texan forces faced off against Mexican troops, resulting in casualties on both sides.
The Texans pursued Woll's retreating army but eventually returned to San Antonio.
These events highlighted the ongoing tensions between Texas and Mexico during this period.

In 1917, two young girls in Cottingley, England, claimed to have photographed fairies, sparking a sensation.
Despite skepticism, the photos were deemed genuine by some experts, including Arthur Conan Doyle.
Doyle, grieving the loss of his son and brother, was drawn to spiritualism and believed in the photos.
The girls eventually admitted to faking the photos, but maintained they had seen real fairies.
The story continued to captivate the public, with books, films, and exhibitions dedicated to the hoax.
The moral of the story is to question what is considered impossible and to critically examine extraordinary claims.

The text discusses the history of the Will-O-Wisp hair net, which is named after the Medieval Latin term for foolish fire.
It explores the connection between the name and the fairies photographed by two young cousins in Cottingley, England in 1917.
The cousins, Elsie and Frances, claimed to have captured images of fairies near a stream, which caught the attention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and other spiritualists.
Despite skepticism from some experts, Doyle and Edward Gardner believed in the authenticity of the photos, using them to promote spiritualism.
However, in 1985, Elsie and Frances admitted that the photos were faked, but they had kept quiet to avoid embarrassing Doyle.
The text also touches on the human need for belief in the supernatural, especially in times of tragedy, such as after World War I. Ultimately, the story of the Cottingley fairies highlights the power of imagination and the resilience of the human spirit in coping with loss and grief.

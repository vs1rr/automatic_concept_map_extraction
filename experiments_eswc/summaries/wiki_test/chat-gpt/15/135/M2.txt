Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was a believer in spiritualism, fairies, and other occult ideas.
Spiritualism, which began in the mid-19th century in the United States, promised tangible evidence of an afterlife in response to the demands of emerging science.
The movement gained popularity after the Fox family claimed to communicate with the spirit of a murdered peddler in Hydesville, New York.
This led to the rise of mediums conducting seances and communicating with the dead through various methods.
Despite skepticism and exposure of fraudulent practices, spiritualism flourished and still exists today.


Doyle's belief in spiritualism extended to fairies, as he accepted photographs taken by two teenage girls in Yorkshire in 1917 as genuine evidence of fairies.
The photos showed the girls with fairies dancing and interacting in their garden.
Despite suspicions of fraud, photographic experts declared the negatives had not been tampered with.
Doyle defended the authenticity of the photos, even writing pamphlets and a book on the subject.
However, in 1982, the girls admitted to faking the first four photos using paper cutouts of fairy drawings.


Doyle's gullibility in believing in spiritualism and fairies led to criticism and questioning of his intelligence.
His defense of the Cottingley fairy photos, despite evidence of fraud, showcased his willingness to believe in the supernatural.
The girls' admission of fakery highlighted the power of suggestion and predisposition to believe in such phenomena.
Despite the debunking of the fairy photos, some people still believe in their authenticity.


The story of Arthur Conan Doyle's belief in spiritualism and fairies serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of blind faith and the susceptibility to deception.
It also highlights the importance of critical thinking and skepticism in evaluating extraordinary claims.
Doyle's legacy as a brilliant writer is overshadowed by his credulous acceptance of supernatural phenomena, which continues to fascinate and intrigue people to this day.

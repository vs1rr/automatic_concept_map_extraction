The Cottingley fairies were a hoax involving photographs of cardboard cut-out fairies, created by Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths in 1917.
Despite doubts about their authenticity, famous novelist Arthur Conan Doyle believed in the fairies and even wrote a book about them.
The hoax was eventually revealed in 1981, but many continued to believe in the fairies.

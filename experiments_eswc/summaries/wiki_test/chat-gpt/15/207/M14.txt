The text also explores the personal motivations and experiences of the hunger strikers, highlighting their struggle for dignity and self-worth in the face of harsh conditions and political conflict.
Ultimately, the hunger strikes were a complex and tragic chapter in the history of Northern Ireland, with lasting implications for the peace process and the IRA's political strategy.

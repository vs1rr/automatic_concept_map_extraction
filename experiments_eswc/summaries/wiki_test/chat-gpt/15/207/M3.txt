The Troubles in Northern Ireland was a period of ethno-political conflict that lasted from the late 1960s to 1998.
It was primarily centered around the Constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the relationship between the mainly Protestant Unionist and mainly Catholic Nationalist communities.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary's attack on a Catholic civil rights protest in 1969 sparked violence that led to the formation of the Provisional IRA.
The Hunger Strike of 1981, led by Bobby Sands, was a pivotal moment in the IRA's campaign to remove British influence from Irish politics.
The strike brought worldwide media attention to the conflict and ultimately led to changes in the treatment of IRA prisoners.
Bernadette McAliskey, a prominent political figure, was involved in the civil rights movement and later became a Member of Parliament.
Mairead Farrell, a volunteer for the IRA, played a significant role in the 1980 and 1981 hunger strikes, leading female prisoners in their protest.
Bobby Sands, another IRA member, led the 1981 hunger strike and died after 66 days without food.
Michael Gaughan, also a hunger striker, died in 1974 after being force-fed during his strike.
These individuals and events were instrumental in shaping the course of the Troubles and the fight for Irish independence.

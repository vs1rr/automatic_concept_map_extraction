The introduction to ‘Hunger Strike’ by Danny Morrison reflects on the 1981 hunger strike in Northern Ireland, which lasted seven months and resulted in the deaths of ten prisoners.
The text highlights the brutal conditions faced by republican prisoners in the H-Blocks, including beatings, solitary confinement, and loss of basic rights.
The prisoners engaged in protests such as the blanket protest and hunger strikes to demand political status.
The British government's refusal to grant political status led to the escalation of the protests, culminating in the hunger strike.
The text also discusses the lack of support from Irish artists, writers, and poets during this period, as well as the impact of the hunger strike on the Republican Movement and the broader nationalist community.
The introduction concludes with a reflection on the enduring legacy of the hunger strike and the courage of the prisoners who participated in it.

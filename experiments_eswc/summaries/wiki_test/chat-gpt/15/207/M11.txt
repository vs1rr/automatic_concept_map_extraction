The text discusses the history of hunger strikes in Northern Ireland, focusing on the period from 1972 to 1982.
It begins with the story of Sevgi Erdogan, a Turkish political prisoner who died after a hunger strike inspired by Bobby Sands.
The narrative then shifts to the hunger strikes led by IRA members in the 1970s and the challenges they faced due to British policies of criminalization.
The text also covers the formation of the National H-Block Committee and the subsequent hunger strikes in the early 1980s, culminating in the election of Bobby Sands as an MP.
The hunger strikes ultimately ended in October 1981, with the prisoners not achieving their demands.
The conclusion reflects on the efforts of ordinary people involved in the anti-criminalization campaign and the challenges faced by the National H-Block/Armagh Committee in leading an effective campaign.
Despite financial difficulties and limited communication, the Committee's role in the broader struggle against criminalization is questioned.

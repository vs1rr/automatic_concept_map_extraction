The Ex Parte Crow Dog case in 1883 established that U.S. courts did not have jurisdiction over crimes committed by one Native American against another on reservation lands.
The ruling upheld tribal sovereignty over internal affairs, including murder cases.
However, Congress quickly reacted by passing the Major Crimes Act of 1885, which allowed federal courts to assume jurisdiction over certain crimes on Indian lands.
This decision had a significant impact on the relationship between Native American tribes and the U.S. government.

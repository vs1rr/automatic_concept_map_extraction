In 1883, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Ex Parte Crow Dog reaffirmed Native American nations' right to be ruled by their own laws.
Crow Dog had killed Spotted Tail, leading to a trial tainted by prejudice and perjury.
Crow Dog argued against federal jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court agreed, citing respect for Native American sovereignty.
However, the decision was marred by racist language.
Congress later passed the Major Crimes Act of 1885, undermining Native American self-government.
In United States v. Kagama (1886), the Supreme Court upheld the act, citing a duty to protect Native Americans.
This marked the beginning of federal jurisdiction over crimes committed by one Native American against another.
The case of Crow Dog highlights the fragile nature of legal promises and the impact of racism on Native American sovereignty.
Crow Dog continued to be a leader among the Brul√© people until his death

In 1883, the Supreme Court ruled in the case Ex Parte Crow Dog that the territorial court of Dakota did not have jurisdiction to try an indictment for murder committed by one Indian upon another in the Indian country.
Crow Dog, a member of the Brule Sioux Band, had killed Spotted Tail, the principal Chief of the Brule Sioux, and was sentenced to death.
However, under Sioux law, a murderer could be exiled or the victim's family could kill him unless restitution was made.
Crow Dog settled with Spotted Tail's family to avoid further bloodshed.
When white settlers demanded justice, Crow Dog was tried and convicted in the territorial court, but the Supreme Court overturned the decision, ruling that the Sioux retained exclusive judicial jurisdiction over reservation affairs.


In 1890, Sitting Bull was killed by Indian police, leading to the Massacre at Wounded Knee where 300 men, women, and children were killed.
The Indian police were detailed to take Sitting Bull at the Ghost Dance outbreak, and after his death, the Sioux were forced onto reservations and faced harsh government control.
The Black Hills were taken from the Sioux in violation of the 1868 Treaty, leading to starvation and forced assimilation through farming and education at Indian boarding schools.


In 1885, Sitting Bull signed an agreement to travel with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show for a salary, and in 1887, the Standing Rock Indian Reservation was opened to homesteading.
The Sioux people continued to resist government control and fight for their rights, facing challenges such as the Sell or Starve Bill and the forced acceptance of conditions imposed by the government.
Despite these challenges, the Sioux people continued to resist and fight for their land and rights.

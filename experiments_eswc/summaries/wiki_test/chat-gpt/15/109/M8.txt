Norfolk has a rich history of human occupation dating back to the Palaeolithic era, with both modern and Neanderthal people present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago.
The archaeological record is limited due to cold conditions and shifting coastlines, with many ancient sites now submerged under the North Sea in an area known as Doggerland.
Blakeney, a medieval port, played a significant role in trade and maritime activities, but faced challenges such as silting and declining trade in the 19th century.
The area became famous for wildfowling in the decades before World War I, leading to the establishment of a bird sanctuary on Blakeney Point.
In 1912, the National Trust acquired Blakeney Point, which was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and later became a National Nature Reserve.
The area is now part of the Norfolk

The Bricker Amendment was a proposed amendment to the Constitution aimed at limiting the power of the president, particularly in regards to executive agreements and treaties.
It was supported by Republicans who were critical of the foreign policies of Democratic presidents in the 1930s and 1940s.
The amendment sought to prevent presidents from bypassing the Senate treaty-review process and entering into agreements that could lead to war without proper oversight.
Despite initial support, the amendment was ultimately defeated, with key figures such as Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator Lyndon Johnson opposing it.
The amendment's failure highlighted the ongoing struggle to balance presidential power with the constitutional separation of powers.
The Bricker Amendment remains relevant today as a potential check on the authority of the executive branch.

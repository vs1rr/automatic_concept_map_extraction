The Bricker Amendment was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution in the 1950s that aimed to limit the scope and ratification of treaties and executive agreements entered into by the United States.
Sponsored by Senator John W. Bricker, a conservative Republican, the Amendment was a response to concerns about the loss of American sovereignty to international organizations like the United Nations.
Non-interventionism, the belief that the United States should not become involved in foreign conflicts, was a strong sentiment in American politics following World War I. The Amendment faced opposition from President Dwight D. Eisenhower and ultimately failed in the Senate by a single vote in 1954.
Despite its defeat, the ideas behind the Bricker Amendment continue to have supporters and have been reintroduced in Congress periodically.

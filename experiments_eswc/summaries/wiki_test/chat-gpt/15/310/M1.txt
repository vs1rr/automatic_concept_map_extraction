The Supreme Court has granted review in the case of Bond v. United States, which involves a question of legal standing regarding the constitutional power of Congress to enact a federal law under which the defendant, Ms. Bond, is being prosecuted.
The Third Circuit ruled that Bond lacked standing, but the Solicitor General concedes that this ruling was mistaken.
The case raises important questions about the scope of federal power under treaties, although the lower courts did not address this issue.
The underlying merits of the case involve statutory interpretation and a constitutional objection to Congress's authority to regulate intrastate crime through chemical means.
The case also raises questions about the treaty power and its implications for federal laws.
The author argues that the substantive issues in the case are more important than the standing issue that the Court has agreed to review.
The case could have implications for the health care law and the individual mandate, as well as broader questions about the limits of federal power.
Ultimately, the decision in this case could have significant ramifications for future cases involving the scope and vitality of Missouri v. Holland, a precedent regarding the treaty power of Congress.

period of years, culminating in the passage of the National Commitments Resolution in 1970.

This resolution defined American national commitments as resulting only from affirmative action taken by the executive and legislative branches of the United States Government by means of a treaty, statute, or concurrent resolution of both Houses of Congress, specifically providing for such commitment.

The resolution was intended to ensure that the collective judgment of the Congress would be brought to bear on decisions involving the activities of United States Armed Forces which could lead to ongoing hostilities.

The Committee on Foreign Relations has the principal responsibility for oversight of these matters within the Senate.

Legislative oversight activities are also a key responsibility of the Committee, which includes reviewing, studying, and reporting on matters relating to the national security policy, foreign policy, and international economic policy as it relates to foreign policy of the United States.

The Committee also has the authority to study and review matters relating to food, hunger, and nutrition in foreign countries, and to report on these issues from time to time.

In conclusion, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate plays a crucial role in the formulation of American foreign policy, with responsibilities that include advising and consenting to treaties and nominations, considering bills and resolutions, and conducting legislative oversight activities.
The Committee has a long history of bipartisan cooperation and has been involved in key foreign policy decisions throughout the history of the United States.
Its work is essential in ensuring that the Senate's voice is heard in matters of international importance, and that the interests of the United States are protected and promoted on the global stage.

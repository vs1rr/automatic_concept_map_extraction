This paper examines the crusade of a group of conservative women, the Vigilant Women for the Bricker Amendment (VWBA), in the 1950s to pressure politicians and sway public opinion in favor of the Bricker Amendment, which aimed to limit the treaty-making powers of the President.
The VWBA, born out of influential conservative organizations, promoted anti-statist and anti-internationalist ideas at the grassroots level.
The paper explores the domestic ideology and populist rhetoric in the discourse of the VWBA and their allies, highlighting the role of women in conservative grassroots activism.
Despite the defeat of the Bricker Amendment, the VWBA's efforts had a lasting impact on conservative women's activism and the political landscape.

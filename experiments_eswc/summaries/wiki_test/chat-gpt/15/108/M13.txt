Belton House's Queen's Bedroom is haunted by "the gentleman in black" who shares the space with the "bright lady", Lady Alice Sherald.
The room is named after Queen Adelaide and features a canopy bed refurbished in the Rococo style.
Belton House has been owned by the Brownlow and Cust family since the 16th century and was opened to the public in 1984.

Castles were built during the Middle Ages as fortified homes for kings and nobility to defend themselves and rule over their land.
They were originally made of wood and later replaced with stone for strength.
Common features included moats, keeps, curtain walls, arrow slits, gatehouses, and battlements.
Famous castles include Windsor Castle, Tower of London, and Chateau Gaillard.
Siege engines were used to attack castles, and many were built on springs for water during a siege.
Cats and dogs were kept

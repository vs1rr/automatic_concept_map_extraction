Edward I's Welsh Castles played a significant role in the period from 1297 to 1413, contributing to the conquest and later governance of Wales.
These castles, built by Edward and his master mason James of St. George, served multiple purposes including socio-economic and administrative functions, military defense, and as propagandist symbols of English authority over Wales.
While their military role may have been less significant than initially thought, the castles played a crucial role in attracting English settlers to Wales, providing security, and enforcing English regal rights.
The castles also served as centers of legal enforcement and governmental outposts, strengthening royal control over the region.
Despite their high cost and lavish construction, the castles were effective in maintaining English supremacy in Wales, deterring Welsh uprisings, and serving as symbols of Edward's power and authority.
Ultimately, the castles played a key role in shaping the conquest and governance of Wales during this period.

The article discusses the concept of "CSI effects," which refers to the potential influence of popular crime television shows like Crime Scene Investigations (CSI) on legal decisions.
Concerns have been raised about the portrayal of forensic work in these shows, with some arguing that they create unrealistic expectations among jurors, judges, lawyers, and the public.
While some positive effects, such as increased awareness of forensic evidence, have been noted, the majority of effects are seen as negative, potentially leading to unwarranted acquittals based on misconceptions from fictional portrayals of science.


Research has shown that while professionals in the legal and forensic fields believe in the existence of CSI effects, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that viewing crime shows like CSI negatively impacts jury verdicts.
Studies have also found that frequent CSI viewers may have higher expectations of forensic evidence but that this does not necessarily translate into biased verdicts.
Jurors have demonstrated the ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality, with perceived realism of CSI shows playing a role in their trust in forensic evidence.


Overall, the article concludes that discussions about CSI effects need more nuance, and until evidence emerges that frequent CSI viewing distorts jury verdicts, there is no need to modify court procedures.
The authors emphasize the importance of evidence-based policy-making in the criminal justice system and caution against making changes based on assumptions rather than empirical data.

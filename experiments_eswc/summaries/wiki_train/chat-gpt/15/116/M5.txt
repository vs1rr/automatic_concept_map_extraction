Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, was an English diplomat known for his lone vote against the condemnation of Mary, Queen of Scots, and for organizing a stag-hunt where the Archbishop of Canterbury accidentally killed a man.
Zouche was a royal ward under William Cecil and married Eleanor Zouche, with whom he had two daughters.
After Eleanor's death, he married Sarah Harrington.
Zouche served as a Commissioner for the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, Ambassador to Scotland, and held various other offices.
He was also involved in the Virginia Company and had an interest in horticulture.
Zouche died in 1625, and the Barony of Zouche fell into abeyance between his daughters.
A document found in the house of Sir Jasper More revealed Zouche's involvement in sending four children to America on the Mayflower.
Zouche's legacy includes his involvement in various diplomatic and governmental roles, as well as his unfortunate association with the Archbishop of Canterbury's accidental killing during a stag-hunt.

Bramshill House, located in Bramshill, northeast Hampshire, England, is a significant Jacobean mansion built in the early 17th century by Baron Edward la Zouche.
The house is situated in a triangular area formed by Reading, Basingstoke, and Farnborough, about 47 miles southwest of central London.
Originally built between 1351 and 1360, the house had thick walls, vaulted cellars, and an internal courtyard.
It was later renovated and expanded by subsequent owners, including Lord Zouche, who added a new house in the early 17th century.
The mansion features Italian Renaissance-inspired architecture, with symmetrical elevations, large gables, and ornate details.
The interior is richly furnished with period pieces, tapestries, and portraits.
The Great Hall, drawing room, library, and Long Gallery are some of the notable rooms in the house.
The estate includes 262 acres of grounds with an 18-acre lake and formal gardens.
The property has a rich history, serving as a Red Cross maternity home during World War II and later as the residence of King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania.
In 1960, it became the Police Staff College and later housed the European Police College.
Due to escalating maintenance costs, the property was sold to heritage property developers in 2014.
The house is also known for its ghost stories, with 14 reported ghosts, including a bride who locked herself in a chest on her wedding night.
Bramshill House is a Grade I listed building and a significant example of Jacobean architecture in England.

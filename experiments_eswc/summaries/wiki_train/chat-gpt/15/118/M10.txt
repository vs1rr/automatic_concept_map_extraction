Brougham Castle in Cumbria was built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vieuxpont.
It was strategically located between the rivers Lowther and Eamont, with views of the Eden Valley.
The castle was confiscated by the Crown in 1264 but later returned to the de Vieuxpont family.
It passed to the de Clifford family in 1269 through marriage.
The castle was improved for defense during the Anglo-Scottish War.
It fell into disrepair

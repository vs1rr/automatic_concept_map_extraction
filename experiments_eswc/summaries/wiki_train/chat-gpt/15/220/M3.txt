A protectorate is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state.
Protectorates differ from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of.
Protectorates usually accept specified obligations in exchange for their autonomy, which may vary greatly depending on the nature of their relationship with the greater sovereign state.
Protectorates are different from protected states, which are states that remain under the protection of another state but still retain independence.


Amical protection is a form of protectorate where the terms are often very favorable for the protectorate.
The protector's political interest is often moral or aimed at countering a rival or enemy power.
In modern times, microstates are considered modern protected states, where certain attributes of sovereignty are delegated to larger powers in exchange for protection against geographic or demographic constraints.


Colonial protection conditions are generally less generous for areas of colonial protection, often reducing the protectorate to a de facto condition similar to a colony.
Protectorates can be established by traditional states or by chartered companies, which become de facto states in their European home state.
Protectorates often have direct foreign relations only with the protecting power and rely on the protector for defense.


British protectorates were territories where the Crown had ultimate power and jurisdiction, but did not formally annex them.
Protected states were territories under a ruler that enjoyed British protection over foreign affairs.
The British established protectorates in various regions, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

French protectorates were often colonial and established in regions such as Asia, the Arab world, Madagascar, and sub-Saharan Africa.
The legal regime of protection was used by French colonial forces to expand in Africa between the 1830s and 1900.
French protectorates were gradually replaced by direct rule.


Other countries, such as Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United States, also established protectorates in various regions.
The United States still uses the term protectorate to refer to insular areas such as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The United Nations has also been involved in establishing protectorates in regions such as West Papua, Cambodia, and East Timor.


Joint protectorates, such as the Adriatic Republic of Ragusa and the United States of the Ionian Islands, were established as joint protectorates by multiple powers.
Bosnia and Herzegovina was a joint Austrian and Hungarian protectorate until it was annexed by Austria-Hungary.


Overall, protectorates have played a significant role in international relations, providing a balance between autonomy and suzerainty for dependent territories.
They have been established by various countries throughout history in different regions of the world.

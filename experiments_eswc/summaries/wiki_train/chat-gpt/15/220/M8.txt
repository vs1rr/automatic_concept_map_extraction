The British Empire was the largest empire in history, covering a quarter of the world and making the United Kingdom the most powerful country for over a century.
It began in the 17th century and lasted until the mid-20th century, consisting of dominions, colonies, protectorates, and mandates ruled by the UK.
The empire spread English influence globally, with 458 million people by the 1920s.
However, setbacks like the American War of Independence and World Wars weakened the empire.
After World War II, decolonization led to independence for many countries, causing underlying tensions to surface.

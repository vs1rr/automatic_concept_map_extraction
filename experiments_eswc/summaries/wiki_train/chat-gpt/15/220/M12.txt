A recent poll in the UK found that a significant portion of Britons are proud of the British Empire, despite knowing little about its dark history of slave-trading, famine, and massacres.
The history of the empire is not widely taught in UK schools, leading to a lack of awareness among the population.
Calls have been made for a more honest approach to teaching about the empire's crimes, with some historians emphasizing the need for better education and public debate.
The comparison is drawn between Britons' pride in their colonial past and Russians' feelings towards Stalin, highlighting the tendency for great powers to downplay their own wrongdoings while magnifying those of others.
The author suggests that instead of comparing histories, it may be more productive for each country to focus on understanding and accepting their own past.
History is complex and nuanced, and a deeper understanding of it is crucial for informing our present and shaping our future.

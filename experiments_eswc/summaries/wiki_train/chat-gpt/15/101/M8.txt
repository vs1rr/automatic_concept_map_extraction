The investigation into the collapse of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, led to 31 recommendations to improve building safety and emergency responses.
The investigation, led by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), faced challenges due to the destruction of evidence.
Through extensive analysis, the investigators determined that the towers could have withstood the impact and fires if not for dislodged fireproofing insulation and other factors.
The collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 was attributed to uncontrolled fires, leading to structural weakness.
NIST's recommendations for building safety improvements were met with criticism, particularly regarding the lack of consensus over the investigation results.
Despite this, changes to building codes have been implemented, including requirements for additional exit stairwells, glow-in-the-dark markings in stairwells, and more effective fire-resistive materials.
These changes have been adopted by state and local authorities, with New York City and new projects like One World Trade Center already implementing them.
The investigation and resulting recommendations have had a significant impact on building safety standards.

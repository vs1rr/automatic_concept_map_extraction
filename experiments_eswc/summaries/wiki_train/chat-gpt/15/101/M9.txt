7 World Trade Center is a building in New York City that has been the focus of conspiracy theories surrounding the events of September 11, 2001.
The original building, completed in 1987, was destroyed on that day and replaced with a new structure that opened in 2006.
Both buildings were developed by Larry Silverstein and were situated above a Consolidated Edison power substation.
The original building had difficulties attracting tenants until Salomon Brothers signed a lease in 1988.
On September 11, 2001, the building was damaged by debris from the nearby North Tower collapse and subsequently caught fire, leading to its complete collapse at 5:21:10 p.m.
The new 7 World Trade Center, completed in 2006, was designed with safety in mind and incorporates environmentally friendly features.
The collapse of the building was investigated by FEMA and later by NIST, with the primary cause determined to be uncontrolled fires fueled by office contents and lack of water to fight the fires.
The collapse caused substantial damage to neighboring buildings, including the Borough of Manhattan Community College's Fiterman Hall and the Verizon Building.
The collapse also resulted in the destruction of SEC files and other federal investigative files housed in the building.
The collapse of 7 World Trade Center is significant as it was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily due to uncontrolled fires, leading to various conspiracy theories about controlled demolition, which have been rejected by NIST.

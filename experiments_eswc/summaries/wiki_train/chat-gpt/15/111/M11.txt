Bodiam Castle, described as resembling a giant sandcastle, is a unique medieval structure that was built during a time when nobility sought both security and luxury.
The castle was constructed by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge, a powerful figure in Sussex, who gained wealth and influence through military exploits in France.
The castle passed through various hands over the centuries, eventually being saved from destruction by John 'Mad Jack' Fuller in 1815.
Lord Curzon played a significant role in researching and restoring the castle in the early 20th century, eventually leaving it to The National Trust.
Today, Bodiam Castle is open to visitors and offers a glimpse into medieval history, with excellent car parking facilities and wheelchair access to the grounds.
The castle is a popular destination for families, with a well-stocked shop and restaurant on-site.
Visitors can enjoy picnics in the grounds and explore the castle's exterior, which remains well-preserved.
While the interior may not be as impressive to some, Bodiam Castle's historical significance and picturesque setting make it a must-visit attraction in Britain.

The period from 1848 to 1865 in California was marked by the Gold Rush, statehood, and the Western movement.
The discovery of gold in 1848 brought a diverse array of immigrants to California, drastically changing the social landscape.
The native population suffered greatly during this time, with their numbers plummeting due to the disruptions caused by the Gold Rush.
The imposition of American government in California also led to the decline of elite Californios, who lost power, authority, and land.
Conflict arose between white Americans and "foreign miners," particularly Latin Americans, leading to discriminatory practices and violence.
Chinese immigrants also faced prejudice and challenges in their pursuit of gold.
African Americans sought equality in California but faced discrimination and legal restrictions.
Despite these challenges, there were instances of cross-cultural cooperation and communication in Gold Rush California.
The state's diversity continued to shape its development in the years to come.

The Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II.
Led by the United States with support from the United Kingdom and Canada, the project began in 1939 and employed over 130,000 people, costing nearly $2 billion.
The project developed two types of atomic bombs: a gun-type fission weapon using uranium-235 and an implosion-type nuclear weapon using plutonium.
The timeline of the Manhattan Project includes key events such as the creation of the Advisory Committee on Uranium in 1940, the establishment of the Manhattan Engineering District in 1942, and the first nuclear explosion in 1945.
The project culminated in the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.
The Manhattan Project was officially turned over to the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1947, marking the end of the project.
Throughout its timeline, the Manhattan Project faced challenges, made significant scientific advancements, and ultimately changed the course of history with the development and use of atomic weapons.

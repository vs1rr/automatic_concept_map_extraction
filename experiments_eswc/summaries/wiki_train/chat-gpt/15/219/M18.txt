The Manhattan Project was a U.S. government research project from 1942 to 1945 that produced the first atomic bombs.
American scientists, including refugees from Europe, organized the project to exploit the fission process for military purposes.
The project involved various research methods to separate uranium-235 and plutonium-239 for bomb production.
The project also included the development of the bomb design and functioning, as well as methods for delivering the weapon.
The first atomic bomb was successfully tested in July 1945 in New Mexico, with explosive power equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT.
The following month, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, leading to the end of World War II.
The project grew from an initial $6,000 budget to $2 billion, and involved the collaboration of scientists from the U.S., Great Britain, and Canada.
The success of the Manhattan Project marked a significant milestone in the history of nuclear weapons.

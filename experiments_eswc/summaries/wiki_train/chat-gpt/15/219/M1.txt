The text discusses the role of the British in the Manhattan Project, highlighting the controversy surrounding their involvement.
James B. Conant, a key figure in the project, argued that the US should essentially abandon the British in the later stages of the work due to concerns about secrecy and the British not contributing significantly to the war effort.
However, the British eventually gained equal participation through the Quebec Agreement, despite initial resistance from Conant and others.
The text also mentions the challenges of controlling secrecy and the eventual discovery of atomic spies, including Klaus Fuchs.
While the British delegation made important contributions to the project, they were largely excluded from certain aspects by General Groves.
In the end, the British did play a significant role in the practical realization of the atomic bomb, despite initial doubts about their contributions.

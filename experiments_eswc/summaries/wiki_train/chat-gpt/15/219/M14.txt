The Los Alamos Historical Society recently discussed the eighth episode of WGN's Manhattan, focusing on the British scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project.
The British Mission, led by Professor James Chadwick, provided essential expertise to the project.
The episode also explored the reasons why the Thin Man bomb was not built, due to the discovery of impurities in reactor-produced plutonium.
Additionally, the episode highlighted the devastating events in Minsk during World War II.
The discussion also touched on scientific concepts such as Schr√∂dinger's cat and quotes from William Butler Yeats and Virginia Woolf.
The community continues to gather weekly to watch and discuss the series, with updates posted on the Historical Society's website and Facebook page.

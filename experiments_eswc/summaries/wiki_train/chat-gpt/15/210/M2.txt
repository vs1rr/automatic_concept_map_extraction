During Lent, Christians are called to leave behind the comforts and temptations of Egypt, symbolizing worldly pleasures and sin.
The story of the ancient Israelites leaving Egypt serves as a model for our own spiritual journey, as we are called to depend on God and separate ourselves from sin.
Just as the Israelites had to rely on God for sustenance in the desert, fasting and abstinence during Lent remind us of our dependence on God and strengthen our resolve against sin.
Egypt, with its luxuries and advancements, represents the allure of worldly pleasures and the enslavement of sin.
By leaving Egypt behind, we are called to renew our commitment to a holy life and put our old, fallen selves behind us.
Lent is a time to courageously step into the desert, away from the comforts of Egypt, and towards a deeper relationship with God.

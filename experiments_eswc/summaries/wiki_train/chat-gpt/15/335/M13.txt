mocked in the disappearance of the wedding feast and its replacement with a mock feast of bones and stones, as well as in the witchesâ€™ ability to steal food and drink from the barn.

The witchesâ€™ ability to disrupt the traditional roles of host and guest, as well as their ability to transform food into inedible objects, challenges the male authority of the household.

Similarly, Mistress Generousâ€™s use of a magic bridle to transform her husbandâ€™s servant into a horse and force him to serve her pleasure, both as transport and as a sexual service-provider, subverts the traditional roles of husband and wife.

The play highlights the power dynamics of gender and class in the context of hospitality and food, showing how the witches use their magic to challenge and disrupt traditional social hierarchies.

Overall, The Late Lancashire Witches uses themes of sport, game, sexuality, and hospitality to explore the power dynamics between men and women, as well as between different social classes, in a comedic and satirical manner.

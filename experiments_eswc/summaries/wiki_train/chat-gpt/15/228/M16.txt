San Felipe de Austin, located near present-day Houston, was the "Birthplace of Anglo-American Settlement in Texas."
Founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin, it became the unofficial capital of his colony.
The town played a significant role in Texas history, hosting important meetings that led to the Texas Declaration of Independence.
In 1836, the town was burned by Santa Anna's invading Mexican army but was later restored after Texas' victory in the War for Independence.
The town served as a hub for trade, education, and government in early Texas, with notable residents including Stephen F. Austin, Gail Borden, and Josiah H. Bell.
San Felipe was also a center for the Texas postal service and the site of the first English language newspaper in Texas.
After the Texas Revolution, the town's population declined, and administrative functions were moved to Bellville.
The original town site now lies within the Stephen F. Austin State Historical Park, which features monuments and replicas of historical buildings.
The town's population fluctuated over the years, with an influx of German, Czech, and Mexican immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
The town's decline continued into the 20th century, with the population reaching 868 in 2000.
San Felipe's legacy as a key player in Texas history is preserved in the historical park and the memories of its residents.

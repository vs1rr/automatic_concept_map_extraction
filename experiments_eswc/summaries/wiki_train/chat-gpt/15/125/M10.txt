The West Virginia Archives and History Commission held their spring meeting on September 27, 2012 at the Bavarian Inn in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
Chairman Robert Conte presided over the meeting, with several voting and ex officio members present.
The meeting began with a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting, with some revisions suggested by Fredrick Armstrong.
The commission discussed various reports, including updates on recent lectures, donations received by the State Archives, and the completion of delayed state birth certificates being placed online.
They also discussed the sesquicentennial marker project and funding for Civil War and statehood markers throughout the state.


The commission then moved on to review and approve several National Register nominations, including Edgefield, Greenbrier County; Old Pine Church, Hampshire County; Capon Chapel, Hampshire County; Valley View, Hampshire County; Springfield Brick House, Hampshire County; Seebert Lane School, Pocahontas County; Pleasant Green Methodist Episcopal Church, Pocahontas County; Spencer Cemetery, Marshall County; and Buffington Island Battlefield (boundary increase), Jackson County.
Each nomination was presented by a member of the commission and discussed before being approved.


Following the National Register nominations, the commission discussed the commission by-laws, which had been revised in 2002 but never filed with the Secretary of State's office.
After some discussion about the interpretation of the open meeting law and the requirements for a quorum, the commission decided to file the by-laws as procedural rules with the Secretary of State.


The meeting concluded with the scheduling of a special meeting in December to finalize the filing of the by-laws and the announcement of the Winter meeting on January 25, 2013, in Charleston, and the Spring meeting on May 31, 2013, in Elkins.
The meeting was adjourned at 1:14 p.m.


Overall, the meeting covered a range of topics, including National Register nominations, updates on various projects and reports, and discussions about the commission's by-laws.
The commission made decisions on several important matters and set dates for future meetings.

Kenneth R. Maxwell explores the complexities of Brazilian independence in the early 19th century, highlighting the lack of scholarly work on this topic.
He discusses the interconnectedness of events in Portugal and Brazil, emphasizing the economic, political, and social challenges faced during this critical period.
Maxwell delves into the influence of dependency theory on the interpretation of Brazilian independence, as well as the role of external forces, particularly British interests, in shaping the outcome.
He also examines the impact of slavery on Brazilian society and the reluctance to abolish it due to economic and political considerations.
Maxwell contrasts the views of reformers like José Bonifácio, who advocated for the abolition of slavery and European immigration, with the entrenched interests that supported the continuation of the slave trade.
He concludes by reflecting on the unique path Brazil took to independence, marked by gradual changes and the preservation of monarchy and continuity.

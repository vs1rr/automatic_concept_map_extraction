The Empire of Brazil was established in 1822 after the declaration of independence by Dom Pedro.
The First Reign saw the establishment of a monarchical regime, with Dom Pedro I as the emperor.
The Regency Period followed, with representatives governing in the name of Dom Pedro II until he reached majority age.
The Second Reign, under Dom Pedro II, saw a decrease in conflicts and the consolidation of power by the rural landowners.
The economy relied heavily on coffee production, which was carried out by slaves.
The abolition of slavery began with the Eusébio de Queirós law in 1850 and culminated in the Lei Áurea in 1888.
The Paraguayan War and the rubber cycle also played significant roles in Brazilian history during this period.
The monarchy eventually fell due to factors such as economic crisis, dissatisfaction with the laws regarding slavery, religious issues, and political centralization.
The military also sought a larger role in political decisions, and international influence contributed to the shift towards a republic.
The Empire of Brazil was the last American country to abolish slavery, and the effects of this period are still felt in Brazilian society today.

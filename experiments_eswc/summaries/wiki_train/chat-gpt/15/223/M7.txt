In 1453, the Fall of Constantinople occurred during a siege led by Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Turks.
The heavily fortified city was defended by a small force of 10,000 men against the 100,000-150,000 Turkish army.
The Turks used various tactics, including cannons, warships, and infantry, to breach the walls and eventually take over the city.
Despite fierce resistance, the city fell after multiple attacks, with the Turks renaming it Istanbul and imposing new rules on the conquered population.

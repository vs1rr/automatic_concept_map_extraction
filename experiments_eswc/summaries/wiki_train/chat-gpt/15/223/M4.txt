Constantinople, also known as Byzantium, New Rome, or Istanbul, was the capital city of the Eastern Roman Empire.
Founded by Constantine in 330, the city was strategically located on a promontory with natural and man-made fortifications, including defensive walls and a harbor.
The city's geography, with 7 hills like Rome, limited its earlier utilization for sea trade.

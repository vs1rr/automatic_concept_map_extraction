The Byzantine Empire, also known as Byzantium, was the continuation of the Roman Empire centered on Constantinople.
It reached its height under the Macedonian emperors in the late 9th to early 11th centuries, gaining control over various territories.
The empire declined over time, eventually falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1453.
One of its greatest achievements was the codification of Roman law under Justinian.
Byzantine art was primarily created for spiritual purposes, with examples showcasing the culture's splendor and spirituality.
The empire's economic expansion was driven by the demands of the imperial court and administrative hierarchies.
Despite emphasizing their Roman origins, Byzantine culture and language were influenced by Hellenization and theocracy.
The empire played a key role in passing on classical and Near Eastern culture to Renaissance Italy and early modern Europe.
Constantine the Great, the empire's founder, is remembered for moving the seat of the empire to Constantinople and embracing Christianity.

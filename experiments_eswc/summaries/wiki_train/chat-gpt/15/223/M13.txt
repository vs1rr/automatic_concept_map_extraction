The Byzantine-Sassanid War (602-628) was the final and most significant conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires.
The war began in 602 when Khosrau II invaded Byzantine territory in response to the execution of his ally, Emperor Maurice, by Phocas.
The early years of the war saw several successes for the Sassanids, who also faced rebellions within the Byzantine Empire.
In 610, Heraclius the Elder led an army to Egypt, defeating the Byzantine forces there.
In 613, Jerusalem fell to the Sassanids after a brutal siege.
A five-year lull followed, but in 618, the Sassanids resumed their attacks, capturing Egypt.
Heraclius, now emperor, launched a counter-offensive in 624, invading Sassanid territory and achieving several victories.
In 626, the Sassanids attempted to besiege Constantinople but were repelled by the Byzantines and their allies, the Khazars.
Heraclius then formed an alliance with the Turks and invaded Sassanid territory again, defeating Khosrau's forces at Nineveh in 627.
Khosrau was overthrown, and peace was eventually negotiated.
Heraclius returned to Constantinople in triumph, but both empires were left weakened by the long and costly war.

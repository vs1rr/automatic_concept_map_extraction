The Byzantine Empire was the predominantly Greek-speaking continuation of the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, with its capital city in Constantinople.
The empire survived the fragmentation and collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century and thrived for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.
The empire was a powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe for most of its existence.
The borders of the empire evolved over time through cycles of decline and recovery, with notable events such as the reign of Justinian I, the Macedonian dynasty, and the Fourth Crusade impacting its history.
The term "Byzantine Empire" was coined later, with citizens referring to their empire as the Roman Empire.
The empire's legacy includes its role in shaping medieval Europe, preserving classical knowledge, and contributing to the development of Orthodoxy and Slav Orthodox culture.
Despite negative perceptions in the past, modern studies have highlighted the positive aspects of Byzantine culture and its significant impact on European civilization.

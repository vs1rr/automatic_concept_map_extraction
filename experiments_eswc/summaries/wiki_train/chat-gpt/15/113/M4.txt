The Borobudur Temple Compound in Indonesia is a significant ancient Buddhist monument, built in the 8th and 9th centuries by the Sailendra dynasty.
The temple consists of three monuments, with the main Borobudur temple being the largest Buddhist temple in the world.
Over the centuries, the temple was abandoned and covered in volcanic ash, but was later rediscovered and restored in a preservation project that lasted eight years and cost $25 million.
The preservation efforts continue to this day, with recent threats from volcanic eruptions requiring protective measures.
The fact that this Buddhist monument is treasured and protected in a predominantly Muslim country highlights its cultural and historical significance in Indonesia.

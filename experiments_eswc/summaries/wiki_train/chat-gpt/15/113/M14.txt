Borobudur is a Buddhist stupa and temple complex in Central Java, Indonesia dating from the 8th century, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It is the largest Buddhist structure in the world, set in the verdant Kedu Plain with active volcanoes in the backdrop.
The history of Borobudur is shrouded in mystery, with theories suggesting it was built as a religious site in the 8th century during the Sailendra dynasty.
The construction of Borobudur is thought to have taken 75 years and was completed around 825 AD.
The region of Java during this period saw a mix of Hinduism and Buddhism, with many monuments constructed, including Borobudur and the nearby Hindu Prambanan temple complex.


Borobudur was abandoned and hidden for centuries, possibly due to mass conversions to Islam in the 15th century or a volcanic eruption.

The restoration efforts have continued over the years, with the site becoming a major international tourist attraction.

The Alien and Sedition Acts were a series of four bills passed by the Federalist-dominated 5th United States Congress in 1798 and signed into law by President John Adams.
These acts made it harder for immigrants to become citizens, allowed the president to imprison and deport non-citizens deemed dangerous, and criminalized making false statements critical of the federal government.
The Federalists argued that the acts strengthened national security during a naval war with France, while critics viewed them as an attempt to suppress voters who disagreed with the Federalist party and a violation of freedom of speech.
Three of the acts were repealed after Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican party came to power, but the Alien Enemies Act remained in effect and was used in World War I and World War II to imprison and deport aliens.
The Sedition Act resulted in the prosecution and conviction of many newspaper owners critical of the government.
The acts were denounced by Democratic-Republicans and ultimately led to their victory in the 1800 election.
The Alien Enemies Act remains in effect today and was used by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman to detain and deport aliens from hostile nations.
The acts were controversial then and remain so today, with opposition resulting in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions.
The Alien and Sedition Acts were never appealed to the Supreme Court, but subsequent mentions in Supreme Court opinions suggest that the Sedition Act would likely be found unconstitutional today.
The acts were a major issue in the 1800 election and led to pardons for those serving sentences under the Sedition Act.
The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights, as seen in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, reverberated up to the Civil War and beyond.
In the 20th and 21st centuries, the Alien Enemies Acts were used during World War I and World War II to detain and deport aliens, including Japanese Americans during World War II.
The acts remain in effect today and were cited in a controversial proposal by Donald Trump to ban all Muslims from entering the United States.
Critics argue that the proposal violates founding principles and plays into the narrative that the US is at war with the entire Muslim religion.

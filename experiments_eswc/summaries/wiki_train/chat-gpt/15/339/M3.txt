In this essay, Christian G. Fritz explores the concept of interposition as a tool for states to monitor the constitutional operation of the federal government.
He focuses on the views of James Madison, who rejected the idea of nullification but embraced interposition as a means for citizens and state legislatures to express their concerns about the constitutionality of national laws.
Fritz discusses historical examples, such as the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of the 1790s and the Nullification Crisis of the 1830s, to illustrate how interposition was used to challenge perceived constitutional violations.
He emphasizes that interposition was not about nullifying laws but rather about focusing attention on whether the government was acting in accordance with the Constitution.
Fritz also highlights the importance of understanding the concept of collective sovereignty, where the people of the states, acting collectively, hold the ultimate authority over the Constitution.
Ultimately, he suggests that interposition can be a valuable tool for citizens to ensure that the government operates in line with the will of the sovereign people.

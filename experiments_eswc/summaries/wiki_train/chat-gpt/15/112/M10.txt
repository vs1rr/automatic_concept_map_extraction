The Book of Kells is a famous illuminated manuscript written by monks in medieval Ireland over 1,200 years ago.
It contains the four gospels in Latin and is known for its intricate insular majuscule script and colorful illuminations.
The book was transferred to Trinity College Library in Dublin in 1661 and exact facsimile replicas were later published.
A replica was purchased by the Hackley Public

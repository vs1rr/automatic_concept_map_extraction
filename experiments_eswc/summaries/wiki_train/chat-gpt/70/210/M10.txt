Ancient Egypt has a rich history that dates back over 6,000 years to the beginning of settled life along the banks of the Nile River.
The country's geographical and cultural unity has given the Egyptian people a strong sense of identity and pride in their heritage.
Key events in Egyptian history include the unification of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt in the third millennium B.C., which marked the beginning of the Pharaonic Age.
The ancient Egyptians were pioneers in various fields, including belief in life after death, stone building, writing, sailing, astronomy, medicine, and art.
The legacy of ancient Egypt is evident in the country's numerous monuments, from the pyramids of Upper Egypt to the temples of Luxor and Karnak.


The Predynastic Period and the First and Second Dynasties saw the development of written language, religion, and institutions that laid the foundation for Egyptian civilization.
The Nile River played a crucial role in the productivity of the land, with its annual flood cycle influencing the Egyptians' belief in life after death.
The unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under King Menes marked a significant event in Egyptian history, leading to the establishment of a centralized government under a god-king.
The Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and Second Intermediate Period saw periods of strong central authority and cultural development, as well as periods of decentralization and civil war.


The Pyramid Age, associated with the Third Dynasty, saw the construction of monumental pyramids and tombs for the pharaohs.
Pyramid building was a key industry that sustained the growth of pharaonic civilization.
The New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period marked a period of territorial expansion and military strength for Egypt, with Pharaoh Thutmose III extending Egyptian control into Palestine, Syria, and Mesopotamia.
The New Kingdom also saw the rise of sun worship and the monotheism of Pharaoh Akhenaten, who established a new capital city and promoted the worship of the sun god Aten.


The Late Period, from 664 to 323 B.C., saw Egypt facing pressure from major civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East.
Despite these challenges, Egypt maintained an effectively centralized state based on earlier indigenous models.
The Twenty-sixth Dynasty represented the last great age of pharaonic civilization, with Egypt becoming a powerful and united kingdom under Psammethichus I.
The dynasty ended with a Persian invasion, leading to Egypt becoming a Persian province until it regained independence briefly under the Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, and Thirtieth dynasties.
The second Persian occupation of Egypt lasted until 335 B.C., when Egypt regained independence briefly before falling under Greek rule.

The Ramesside Period, characterized by the rule of kings from one family during the 19th and 20th Dynasties, brought prosperity to Egypt.
The period saw a redefinition of the country under the Amen cult, with statues from the Amarna Period being dismantled.
This reformation aimed to unify the faith of the people and strengthen the kingdom.
Kings during this time also made extensions to royal tombs, such as Rameses II adding a peristyle forecourt to Amenhotep III's pylon.
The elaborate design of royal tombs, with multiple chambers and religious texts, reflected the respect for traditional customs.
Queens, like Nefertari, were also honored with decorated tombs containing texts from the Book of Gates and the Book of the Dead.
Family played a significant role during this period, with scenes of the Battle of Qadesh in the tombs of Sety I and Rameses II suggesting a close kinship.
Rameses II even built a massive tomb for his sons, emphasizing the value placed on family and life on earth.
The workers at Deir el-Medina, known for documenting activities and thoughts on ostraca, further exemplified the importance of family and community during the Ramesside Period.
Overall, the period was marked by prosperity, religious reformation, elaborate royal tombs, and a strong emphasis on family and community values.

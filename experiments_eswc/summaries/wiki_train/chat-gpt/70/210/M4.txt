Ancient Egypt was a powerful civilization that lasted for over 3000 years along the Nile River in northeast Africa.
The Nile provided wealth, food, soil, water, and transportation for the Egyptians.
The civilization was divided into three major kingdoms - the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom.
The government, religion, arts, and writing were all important aspects of Ancient Egyptian culture.
The Pharaohs were often buried in pyramids with treasure to help them in the afterlife.
The empire began to weaken around 700 BC and was eventually conquered by other civilizations such as the Assyrian Empire, the Persian Empire, and the Greeks under Alexander the Great.
The Romans eventually made Egypt a province in 30 BC.

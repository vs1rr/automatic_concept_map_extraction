The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt, lasting from 1070-712 B.C., was a time of politically divided rule and diffused power following the death of Ramesses XI.
The period can be divided into three stages, with Dynasty 21 ruling from Tanis in the eastern Delta and the High Priests of Amun ruling from Thebes during the first stage.
The second stage saw a powerful family of Libyan descent ruling in the eastern Delta, with pharaohs of Libyan origin ruling as native Egyptians.
The final stage, Dynasty 23, emerged in the eastern Delta alongside Dynasty 22, leading to further fragmentation in Egypt.
Internal rivalries during this period led to a loss of traditional control over Nubia, with an independent native dynasty ruling from Napata and extending its influence into southern Egypt.
The Nubian king Piankhy successfully invaded Egypt in 728 B.C., marking the beginning of seventy-five years of Nubian rule.


During the Third Intermediate Period, the temple network became a dominant sphere for political aspirations, social identification, and artistic production as centralized royal authority weakened.
While relatively little building took place during this time, there was a flourishing of stylistically and technologically innovative bronze and precious temple statuary.
Temple precincts became favored burial sites, with high-quality royal burial equipment from Tanis showcasing exceptional craftsmanship.
Nonroyal coffins and papyri featured elaborate scenes and texts to ensure the rebirth of the deceased.
The king was emphasized as the child/son of a divine pair, depicted on relief-decorated vessels and small objects in faience and precious metal.
The emergence and development of the mammisi, or birth house, as a subordinate temple celebrating the birth of a juvenile god identified with the sun god and the king, also occurred during this period.

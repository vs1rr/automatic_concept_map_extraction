Ancient Egypt was a civilization located in Northern Africa, centered around the Nile River.
The Nile River, the longest river in the world, was essential to Egyptian life, providing fertile soil for farming in the "Black land" and natural boundaries that helped prevent invasion.
The ancient Egyptians were polytheistic, worshipping many gods, with special importance placed on sun and land gods.
The story of Osiris, who was murdered by his brother Seth and resurrected by his wife Isis, was symbolic for resurrection and new life.


The process of mummification was used to preserve the dead for their future rebirth and resurrection.
Egyptian pyramids were built primarily during the Old Kingdom, serving as large building complexes dedicated to the dead.
The pyramids were stocked with supplies for the Pharaoh's resurrection, including food, furniture, and jewels.
The timeline of major periods in Ancient Egypt includes the Archaic period, Old Kingdom, First Intermediate period, Middle Kingdom, Second Intermediate period, New Kingdom, Late period, Ptolemaic period, and Roman Occupation.


The first king of Egypt united Upper and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom around 3100 BCE, symbolizing the unity of Egypt by wearing a "double crown."
Pharaohs in the Old Kingdom were seen as divine and possessed absolute power, leading to an age of prosperity and splendor.
The Middle Kingdom was considered a "golden age" due to stability and expansion through trade and military conquests.
The New Kingdom saw Egypt become the most powerful state in Southwest Asia, with Pharaohs building massive temples and attempting religious reforms.


The Egyptians were ruled by outsiders, including the Hyskos, who invaded Egypt with war chariots.
The collapse of the empire in 1085 BCE led to foreign rule by Libyans, Persians, Greeks, and Romans.
Egyptian society had a simple structure, organized like a pyramid with the Pharaoh at the top and slaves and servants at the bottom.
Marriage was arranged for young girls and boys, with wives respected and in charge of the household.
Women could own property and inherit, but most careers were closed to them.


The Egyptians invented hieroglyphics, a complex system of writing using pictures and abstract forms.
They also developed a simplified version called hieratic script for business transactions and record-keeping.
Egyptian art, including sculpture, jewelry, and ceramics, had a distinctive style that was easily recognizable.
The Egyptians made advances in mathematics, including a 365-day calendar, and developed technologies in agriculture, literature, and more.

Bodiam Castle, located in East Sussex, England, was built in 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge as a fortress to defend the southern coast of England.
The castle was constructed quickly in one phase and became the center of the manor of Bodiam.
After passing through several generations of the Dalyngrigge and Lewknor families, the castle was eventually sold to Nathaniel Powell in 1644 due to financial difficulties faced by the Tufton family during the English Civil War.
The castle fell into disrepair until it was purchased by John Fuller in 1829, who began restoration work.
Bodiam Castle was later sold to George Cubitt, Lord Curzon, and eventually acquired by the National Trust in 1925.
The castle has since been restored and is open to the public as a popular tourist attraction.
The castle features a wide moat, sweeping battlements, spiral staircases, and a gatehouse with an original wooden portcullis.
The castle is known for its romantic appearance and has been featured in films such as Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
The castle is a Scheduled Monument and a Grade I listed building, and visitors can explore the various chambers and features of the castle, including the murder holes in the gatehouse roof.
The castle is also said to be haunted by various ghosts, adding to its mysterious and historical charm.

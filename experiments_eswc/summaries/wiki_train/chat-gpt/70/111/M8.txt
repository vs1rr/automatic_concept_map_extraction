In 1386, the French prepared to invade England, funding the expedition through high taxes on nobles.
The fleet was extravagantly outfitted with decorations and provisions including food, Dutch mercenaries were hired for the fighting.
The French were confident of victory, believing the English were already defeated.
In response, King Richard II raised an army and appointed commissioners to raise militias and man coastal garrisons.
Lookout posts and barricades were established, some made from French wine barrels filled with sand.
The English plan was to let the French march inland before destroying their supply ships and confronting them in battle.
Sir Edward Dallingridge was granted a license to fortify his manor house, leading to the construction of Bodiam Castle.
However, bad weather dispersed the French fleet, with some ships being captured on the English coast.
The survivors returned to Sluys, unable to attempt another invasion due to the late season and weather conditions.
The threat of invasion had been thwarted, with the English successfully preparing and defending against the French forces.

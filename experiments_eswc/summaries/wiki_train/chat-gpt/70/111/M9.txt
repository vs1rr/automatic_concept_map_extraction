Matthew Johnson, a Professor in the Department of Anthropology at Northwestern University, is interested in landscape archaeology, particularly focusing on Britain and Europe from 1200 to 1800 A.D.
He believes that the main goal of archaeology is to understand and account for humans in the past, regardless of their social status.
Johnson enjoys carefully observing and dissecting the details of the landscape to piece together a bigger picture.
His research has focused on the transition from medieval to early modern rural landscapes, tracing shifts in agricultural and social organization.


In a recent lecture titled "How Castles Work," Johnson challenges the prevailing notion that castles primarily functioned as military posts.
He argues that castles also served as stage settings for various social activities, such as hunting, feasting, and the exercise of lordship and justice.
Castles were surrounded by elaborate designed landscapes that manipulated different views of and from the castle.
Johnson believes that castles were not just military structures, but also political-economic institutions that controlled flows through the landscape, including goods, animals, and humans.


Johnson's focus on Bodiam Castle, one of England's most iconic medieval buildings, exemplifies his belief that castles were more than just defensive fortifications.
Bodiam Castle, built in the 1380s during the Hundred Years War, has been the subject of debate among military theorists and historians.
Johnson's research at Bodiam, in partnership with the National Trust and the University of Southampton, aims to move beyond the military/social debate and explore the castle in its local and regional context.
By conducting topographical and geophysical surveys, Johnson's team has uncovered a complex multi-period site that includes traces of iron and ceramic production, a mill, millpond, and harbor.


Johnson has written a book on castles titled "Behind the Castle Gate" and another book on landscape archaeology called "Ideas of Landscape."
He is currently working on a new book on castles that he hopes will be published in the next two to three years.

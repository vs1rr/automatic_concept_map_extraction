The Texian Consultations at San Felipe in 1832 and 1833 were meetings organized by the colonists in Texas to address their grievances and concerns with the Mexican government.
The first consultation in 1832 focused on issues such as repealing the decree of April 6, 1830, which prohibited North American immigration into Texas, and reducing tariffs on essential goods.
The second consultation in 1833 saw a more divided group of delegates, with some advocating for independent statehood within the Mexican union and others for complete separation from Mexico.
The delegates drafted a constitution and presented petitions to the Mexican government, but their appeals were largely ignored.
Stephen F. Austin, James B. Miller, and Erasmo Seguin were appointed as commissioners to present the proposed constitution to the authorities in Mexico, but only Austin was able to secure some modifications to the immigration law.
Despite his efforts, Austin was later arrested and held without trial for over a year.
The consultations ultimately set the stage for the growing tensions between Texas and Mexico, leading to the Texas Revolution in 1836.

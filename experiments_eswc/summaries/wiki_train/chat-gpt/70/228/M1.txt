The Convention of 1833, held in San Felipe on April 1, was more aggressive than the previous one.
Only a quarter of the fifty-five delegates had attended the earlier gathering, with William H. Wharton presiding and Sam Houston in attendance.
The agenda remained mostly unchanged, with the addition of drafting a constitution to be submitted to the Mexican congress.
The constitution was modeled after American states' constitutions.
Stephen F. Austin was chosen to present the petitions to the Mexican government, initially meeting with some success but eventually being imprisoned in early 1834 without specific charges.
Austin did not return to Texas until September 1835, on the eve of the Texas Revolution.

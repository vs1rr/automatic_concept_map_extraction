The presentation discusses the tension between Mexico and Texas from 1823 to 1833.
Initially, when the Federalists were in power in Mexico City, Texas colonists were able to live undisturbed, creating their own schools, newspapers, and bringing in slaves.
However, when the Centralists came to power in 1829, they put an end to the independent decision-making of the Texans.
The first clash between colonists and Mexican authorities occurred in East Texas in 1826 when Haden Edwards settled 800 families in the Nacogdoches area, only to find families already living there without titles.
This led to the Republic of Fredonia being declared independent from Mexico by Benjamin Edwards, but the rebellion was quickly put down by Mexican troops.


The Mexican government, concerned about American influence in Texas, sent General Manuel de Mier y Teran to investigate.
He observed that Anglos outnumbered Mexican settlers in East Texas and recommended immediate action to prevent Texas from being lost forever.
The Law of April 6, 1830, was enacted to stop immigration from the United States, encourage Mexican and European immigration, and impose taxes on foreign goods.
The conflict escalated at Anahuac, where settlers clashed with Mexican authorities over enforcement of laws, leading to the arrest of lawyers William B. Travis and Patrick C. Jack.
This sparked a rebellion that culminated in the Battle of Velasco and the Turtle Bayou Resolutions, where colonists declared support for Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.


In 1832, a convention was held in San Felipe to discuss changes needed in Texas, with Stephen F. Austin elected as president.
The delegates wanted Texas to become a separate Mexican state, allow immigration from the U.S., improve education, protect from Native Americans, and provide land titles in East Texas.
The resolutions were not presented to the Mexican government, leading to another convention in 1833 where a constitution was drafted for the proposed Mexican state of Texas.
Austin was chosen to deliver the resolutions to Mexico City, but was stalled due to Santa Anna's absence and a cholera epidemic.


Austin's imprisonment in 1834 due to a letter encouraging Texans to form their own government further strained relations.
However, he was eventually released in 1835 and returned to Texas after two years and four months.
Reforms began in Mexico, with the repeal of the law restricting U.S. immigration and improvements to the court and postal system.
The presentation highlights the complex political and social dynamics that characterized the relationship between Mexico and Texas during this period of tension.

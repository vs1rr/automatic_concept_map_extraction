San Felipe de Austin, located near present-day Houston, was founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin and served as the unofficial capital of his colony.
It was a significant center for Texas' early history, hosting important events such as the Conventions of 1832 and 1833, and the Consultation of 1835 which led to the Texas Declaration of Independence.
The town was burned by Santa Anna's army in 1836 but was later restored after Texas' victory at San Jacinto.
San Felipe played a crucial role in the Texas Revolution and was the site of the first English language newspaper in Texas, the Texas Gazette.
Today, the town is a historical site with a park dedicated to Stephen F. Austin and various monuments commemorating its rich history.

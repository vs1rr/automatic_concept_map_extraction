In this text, Publius Huldah discusses the concept of nullification and rebukes those who deny its legitimacy.
She argues that nullification is a natural right of self-defense, rooted in the principles of the Declaration of Independence.
Huldah explains that nullification is a reserved power of the States and The People, and is necessary when the federal government acts outside the Constitution.
She refutes false assertions made by nullification deniers, such as the idea that States cannot nullify unconstitutional acts because the Constitution does not explicitly grant them that power.
Huldah also addresses the misconception that nullification is impossible, emphasizing that it is a valid remedy when the federal government oversteps its constitutional bounds.
Additionally, she clarifies James Madison's stance on nullification, highlighting that he supported the concept in cases of unconstitutional federal actions.
Huldah concludes by urging readers to educate themselves on the Founding Documents and reject misinformation spread by those who oppose nullification.

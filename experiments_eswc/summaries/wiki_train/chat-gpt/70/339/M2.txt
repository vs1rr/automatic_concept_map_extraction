He received his early education at Mount Pleasant and later attended college at the College of New Jersey, now known as Princeton University.
Madison became involved in politics during the American Revolution, serving on various committees and in the Continental Congress.
He played a key role in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, where he presented the Virginia Plan and later wrote The Federalist essays to encourage ratification of the new Constitution.
Madison served in Congress and as Secretary of State under Thomas Jefferson before becoming the fourth president of the United States in 1809.
During his presidency, Madison faced challenges such as the War of 1812, but ultimately left office with a renewed sense of nationalism.

The Alien and Sedition Acts were a series of four bills passed by the Federalist-dominated 5th United States Congress and signed into law by President John Adams in 1798.
These acts included the Naturalization Act, which increased the residency requirement for American citizenship, the Alien Friends Act, which allowed the president to imprison or deport aliens considered dangerous, the Alien Enemies Act, which authorized the president to do the same to male citizens of hostile nations during times of war, and the Sedition Act, which criminalized making false statements critical of the federal government.
The Federalists argued that these acts strengthened national security during an undeclared naval war with France, while critics viewed them as an attempt to suppress voters who disagreed with the Federalist party and a violation of freedom of speech.


The acts were controversial and ultimately led to the victory of the Democratic-Republicans in the 1800 election, with Thomas Jefferson defeating incumbent President Adams.
The Sedition Act and the Alien Friends Act were allowed to expire, but the Alien Enemies Act remained in effect and was revised and codified in 1918 for use in World War I. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt used this act to imprison Japanese, German, and Italian aliens during World War II, and President Harry S. Truman continued to use it to imprison and deport aliens of formerly hostile nations after the war.


The Alien Enemies Acts remained in effect at the outset of World War I and were recodified as part of US war and national defense statutes.
During World War II, Roosevelt used the authority of the revised Alien Enemies Act to issue proclamations to apprehend, restrain, and remove Japanese, German, and Italian non-citizens.
This led to the internment of over 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry, including many US citizens, in camps in the interior of the country.
Hostilities with Germany and Italy ended in 1945, but alien enemies and US citizens continued to be held.


President Truman issued proclamations regarding the removal of alien enemies in the interest of public safety, citing the revised Alien Enemies Act.
The Department of Justice assisted in the prompt removal of alien enemies, including those brought to the US from Latin America.
In 1947, there were still hundreds of ethnic Germans incarcerated at Ellis Island, and efforts were made to cancel outstanding warrants of arrest, removal, or deportation for German aliens still interned.
The Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins that the Alien Enemies Act allowed for detainment beyond the time hostilities ceased until a treaty was signed with the hostile nation or government.


In more recent times, the Alien Enemies Act has been cited in discussions about national security and immigration policy.
In 2015, presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed banning all Muslims from entering the United States as part of the war on terror, citing Roosevelt's application of the Alien Enemies Act.
This proposal sparked international controversy and criticism for singling out a religion and playing into the narrative that the US was at war with the entire Muslim religion.
Critics have called for the repeal of the Alien Enemies Act, but it remains in effect today.

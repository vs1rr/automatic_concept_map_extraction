In his Report on the Virginia Resolutions, James Madison addresses the objections and criticisms raised against the resolutions passed by the General Assembly of Virginia in December 1798.
The resolutions express a firm commitment to defending the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Virginia against any aggression, foreign or domestic.
They also emphasize the importance of maintaining the union of states and opposing any actions that threaten the principles on which the union is based. 


Madison focuses on the third resolution, which asserts that the powers of the federal government are derived from the Constitution and are limited to those explicitly granted by it.
The states, as parties to the Constitution, have the right and duty to interpose if the federal government exceeds its constitutional powers.
This interposition is justified in cases of deliberate, palpable, and dangerous violations of the Constitution, with the aim of preserving the authorities, rights, and liberties of the states. 


Madison argues that the states, as sovereign parties to the constitutional compact, have the ultimate authority to judge whether the Constitution has been violated, especially in cases where the judiciary may not be able to address the issue effectively.
He emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance of power between the branches of government and the states to prevent the abuse of authority. 


Madison also defends the necessity of reaffirming fundamental principles of the Constitution, especially in times when there is a risk of government overreach or infringement on individual rights.
He highlights the role of state governments in safeguarding liberty and ensuring the proper interpretation and application of constitutional principles. 


Overall, Madison's report underscores the importance of upholding the Constitution, respecting the sovereignty of the states, and ensuring that the principles of the founding documents are preserved and protected for future generations.

The idea of nullification, which allows states to reject federal laws deemed unconstitutional, has been circulating among state legislators.
While Thomas Jefferson endorsed nullification in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, James Madison only supported the theory of "interposition," which allows states to express dissatisfaction with federal laws and push for repeal.
Alexander Hamilton also criticized nullification, as it goes against the purpose of the Constitution and could lead to a confederate form of government.
Nullification is unconstitutional and contradicts Article VI of the Constitution, which establishes federal law as supreme.
States have other legal means to oppose unconstitutional legislation, such as filing lawsuits, and should avoid resorting to nullification.

of the American sovereign was crucial to the debate over the state veto.

For Calhoun, the sovereign was the people of the individual states, while for Webster, the sovereign was the people of the United States as a whole.

This fundamental disagreement reflected a broader division in American constitutional thought about the relationship between the states and the national government.

Ultimately, the Nullification Crisis of the 1830s highlighted the ongoing struggle to define the nature of American constitutionalism and the exercise of sovereign powers within the federal system.

In conclusion, the doctrine of interposition, as articulated by James Madison, offers a valuable perspective on the relationship between the states and the national government in American constitutionalism.

Madison's rejection of nullification in favor of interposition as a means for states to monitor the constitutional operation of the government underscores the importance of maintaining a vigilant and informed citizenry in upholding the principles of the Constitution.

By understanding Madison's theory of interposition and its historical context, we can gain insight into the ongoing debates over federalism, constitutionalism, and the exercise of sovereign powers in the United States.

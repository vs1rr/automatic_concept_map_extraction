Harewood Castle, the oldest building at Harewood, underwent a major repair and consolidation project in 2004 and 2005 with support from English Heritage and the Harewood Estate.
The castle was granted a 'license to crenellate' in 1366, indicating its fortification by Sir William de Aldeburgh.
The castle was designed to balance security and comfort, with features like a portcullis, arrow slit windows, and thick walls for defense, as well as mullioned and transomed windows for aesthetics.
The castle's location on a steep slope with views of Wharfedale was meant to impress and demonstrate status.
Surrounding buildings and gardens were also part of the estate.
After de Aldeburgh's son died in 1391, the castle was shared by his daughters and their husbands for over 200 years.
The last resident, Robert Ryther, left around 1630, and by 1657, the castle was uninhabitable and falling apart.
It is unclear what led to the castle's abandonment - whether it was due to neglect, changing preferences, or other reasons.
The fate of the castle remains a mystery, with no definitive answer as to why it was left to deteriorate.

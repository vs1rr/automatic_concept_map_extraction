Medieval European castles were fortified structures that served as residences for kings and nobility.
They were often military installations but could also be luxurious palaces.
As artillery became more powerful in the 15th century, castle-building shifted towards more lavish, palace-like structures.
Examples of well-preserved medieval castles include Caernarfon Castle in Wales, a military installation, and Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany, a palace-castle.
Medieval towns like Rothenburg, Germany, featured wattle and daub houses with timber frames.
Pontefract Castle in England, one of the largest in Western Europe, was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell and was the site of Richard II's murder.

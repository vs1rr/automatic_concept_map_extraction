Edward I's Welsh Castles played a significant role in the period from 1297 to 1413, contributing to the conquest and later governance of Wales.
These castles, built by Edward and his master mason James of St. George, served multiple purposes including socio-economic and administrative functions, military defense, and propaganda to symbolize English authority over Wales.
The castles facilitated the establishment of new towns, served as administrative centers, and played a role in legal reforms that incorporated Wales into English governance.
While the military impact of the castles was limited, they acted as deterrents to uprisings and played a crucial role in protecting English settlements during revolts such as the Glyn Dwr revolt.
The lavish scale of the castles, while costly, helped attract English settlers by providing a sense of security and superiority.
Overall, the castles were instrumental in enforcing English rule in Wales and symbolizing royal power and authority.

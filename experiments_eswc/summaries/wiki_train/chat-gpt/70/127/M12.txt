Pembroke Castle has a rich history dating back to 1093 when Arnulf de Montgomery built the small inner bailey.
The castle withstood a siege by the Welsh and was later reconstructed in stone by William Marshall in the late 12th/early 13th centuries.
The keep, with its cylindrical tower and stone dome, offers stunning views of Milford Haven.
The gatehouse, with its complex defenses, showcases the military architecture of medieval times.
Pembroke Castle is also unique for being built over a natural cavern known as the Wogan.
It is historically significant as the birthplace of Henry VII and has seen attacks during the reign of King Charles I. Today, the castle is owned by a Private Charitable Trust and efforts have been made to bring its history to life through exhibitions and tableaux.
Visitors can explore the castle, shop at a gift shop, and enjoy a cafe and Brass Rubbing Centre during the summer months.

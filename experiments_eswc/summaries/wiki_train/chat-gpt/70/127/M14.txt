Concentric castles are a type of castle with two or more concentric curtain walls, where the outer wall is lower than the inner and can be defended from it.
They resemble one enclosure castle nested inside the other, without a central free-standing keep.
The layout of concentric castles can be rectangular or irregular, depending on the terrain.
The design may have originated in the Crusader states as a response to advances in siege technology.
The outer wall protected the inner one from siege engines, while the inner wall and projecting towers provided flanking fire.
Walls typically include intramural towers, arrow slits, and wall-head defenses.
The gate and posterns are strengthened with a bent entrance and flanking towers.
Concentric castles were expensive to build and were mainly constructed by powerful military orders or kings.
They coexisted with more modest enclosure castles and tower keeps.
Concentric castles appeared in Europe in the 13th century, with examples in Wales built by Edward I. The concept of mutually reinforcing lines of defense with flanking fire was continued in later fortifications.

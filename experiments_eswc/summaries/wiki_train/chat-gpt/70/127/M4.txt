During the Middle Ages, castles were built as fortified homes for kings and nobility to defend themselves and rule over their land.
Originally made of wood, castles were later constructed with stone for added strength.
They were strategically built on hills or near natural features to aid in defense.
Common castle features included a moat, keep, curtain wall, arrow slits, gatehouse, and battlements.
Famous castles such as Windsor Castle, Tower of London, Leeds Castle, Chateau Gaillard, Cite de Carcassonne, Spis Castle, Hohensalzburg Castle, and Malbork Castle have rich histories and unique architectural designs.
Fun facts about castles include the use of siege engines, the practice of sieges, the importance of water sources, the role of the steward, and the presence of cats and dogs to control pests.
Castles were eventually phased out as larger artillery made them vulnerable, but they remain iconic symbols of medieval power and architecture.

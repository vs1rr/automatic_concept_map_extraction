Tower houses were a type of castle built during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries in Europe.
They served as homes for the king or lord, provided defense against enemies, and acted as administrative centers.
Tower houses were simple, functional, and cost-effective structures that symbolized status, power, and rank.
They were commonly rectangular, three to four stories tall, and featured basic moldings around windows and doors.
In England, tower houses were often attached to a hall, while in Scotland, they were larger and more elaborate.
Tower houses were also popular in Italy and France, where they were used as safe havens during times of conflict.
Some surviving examples include Longthorpe Tower in England, Craigmillar Castle in Scotland, and the ducal tower at Siedlecin in Poland.
These tower houses provide insight into medieval life and combine political, social, and artistic history.

Bruce Castle, also known as Lordship House, is a manor house located in Tottenham, London.
Despite its grand name, it has a history filled with questions and mysteries.
The house was originally named Lordship House and was later renamed Bruce Castle by its owner, Henry Hare, Baron Coleraine.
The Tudor Tower, believed to have been a dovecote, is one of the oldest structures on the property.
The house itself has undergone numerous renovations and additions over the years, with the core of the present building believed to have been built during the time of Henry VIII.
The house changed hands frequently, with one notable owner being Hugh Hare, who renamed it Bruce Castle as part of his social ascent.
Hugh Hare's connections at court and support of the king during the Civil War led to the seizure of his properties, including Bruce Castle, by Parliamentary troops.
The house was later returned to him after the Restoration.
Rumors and stories of ghosts, including that of Constantia Lucy who allegedly committed suicide and haunts the house, add to its mysterious history.
In the 19th century, the house was converted into a school under headmaster Sir Rowland Hill, who later became head of the General Post Office and introduced the world's first postage stamp.
The school was known for its progressive curriculum and teaching methods.
After the school closed, the house was acquired by the local council and opened to the public as a museum in 1906.
Today, Bruce Castle continues to be a place of historical interest and intrigue, with its rich past and resident ghost adding to its allure.

Bruce Castle Museum in Tottenham is a valuable resource for Family History and Local History projects, housing archives for the Borough of Haringey including maps, census returns, newspapers, and historical photographs.
The museum, located in a 16th Century manor house with a haunted history, also offers exhibitions and workshops for visiting groups.
Sir Rowland Hill's family once ran a school for boys at Bruce Castle, and the museum opened in 1906 to showcase the local history collections and archives of Haringey.
Two local groups, the Friends of Bruce Castle and the Haringey Local History Forum, support the museum and local history projects.
The Local History Forum has been disbanded, with some functions now absorbed by the Tottenham Civic Society, which aims to educate the public about the history and architecture of Tottenham and preserve features of historic or public interest.
The society also helped develop the 'Summerhill Road' website with the assistance of the museum staff.
Those interested in joining any of these groups can contact the respective membership secretaries.
The museum's mailing list can be joined by contacting the curator.
Overall, Bruce Castle Museum is a valuable resource for those interested in exploring the history of Tottenham and the surrounding area.

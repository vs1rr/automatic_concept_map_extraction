The Fall of Constantinople in 1453 marked the end of the Byzantine Empire as Sultan Mehmed II led the Ottoman Turks in a siege against the heavily fortified city.
With a significant numerical advantage, the Turks employed various war tactics including the use of huge cannons, warships, and infantry to breach the walls and eventually take over the city after fifty days of siege.
The first attack was led by the Bashi-bazouks, followed by the Anatolian Turks from Ishak's army who were more organized and managed to enter the city but were met with fierce resistance from the Christians.
The Janissaries then launched a successful attack at the stockade, leading to the fall of Constantinople.
The Turks also took control of the sea by placing ships in strategic locations to aid in the siege.
Once the city was captured, Mehmed renamed it Istanbul and implemented new rules for the conquered, allowing Greeks to form communities called milets and Christians to practice their religion under certain restrictions.
The fall of Constantinople marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in the city's history under Ottoman rule.

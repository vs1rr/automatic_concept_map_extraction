The Byzantine Empire was the Greek-speaking continuation of the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, with its capital in Constantinople.
It survived the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and thrived for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.
The empire was a powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe, with a complex history of territorial expansion and decline.
The name "Byzantium" originated from a Greek citizen named Byzas who founded the city in 660 BC.
The term "Byzantine Empire" was coined in the 16th century to distinguish Roman from Medieval Greek history.
The empire went through periods of division and reunification, with notable rulers such as Justinian I and Heraclius.
The empire faced challenges from Persians, Slavs, and Islamic forces, as well as internal conflicts such as the Iconoclasm movement.
The Macedonian dynasty brought a golden age to Byzantium in the 10th and 11th centuries, but the empire eventually succumbed to the Ottoman conquest in 1453.

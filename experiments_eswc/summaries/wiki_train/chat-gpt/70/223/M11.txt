The period of warfare in the Balkans from 500AD to 1000AD was characterized by the dominance of the Byzantine Empire, which sought to resist new barbarian invasions from the north.
The Bulgars, Slavs, and Avars were key players in this region during this time.
The Slavs infiltrated the Balkans in small groups, eventually settling in fortified earthworks called grads.
They were led by Zupans and developed a small cavalry called Druzhinas.
The Bulgars, on the other hand, were Asiatic horsemen with heavy noble cavalry and light horse archers.
The Avars, heavy bow-armed cavalry, initially allied with the Byzantines but later turned against them, ravaging the Balkans until they were defeated by Emperor Maurice in 601.
The Byzantine Empire, under Justinian, reached its greatest extent during this time, fighting successful wars against various invaders.
The Slavs, Croats, and Serbs established themselves as semi-independent tribes, throwing off Avar control and engaging in intermittent wars with the Byzantines.
The Bulgars, under Khan Krum, raided westwards into Croatia and Serbia, while Emperor Nicephorus sacked the Bulgar capital of Pliska in 811.
Bulgarian King Boris I was forced to accept Christianity, and his son Symeon fought wars with the Byzantine Empire, gaining territory but ultimately losing to Emperor Basil II.
The Magyars, the last steppe people to settle in the Balkans, established themselves in Hungary under Arpad, invading Northern Italy, Germany, and France until their defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.
The Serbs and Croats also emerged as independent states in the 9th and 10th centuries, facing invasions from various groups but ultimately establishing themselves as distinct entities.
The Dark Ages in the Balkans were marked by invasions and conflicts, leading to the establishment of modern states such as Croatia, Serbia, and Bulgaria, with the Byzantine Empire exerting a dominant influence in the region.

The Battle of Manzikert took place on August 26, 1071 between the Byzantine Empire and Seljuk Turkish forces led by Alp Arslan, resulting in the defeat of the Byzantine Empire and the capture of Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes.
The Seljuk Turks had been causing trouble in Armenia and Asia Minor, sacking cities and plundering farmland.
Romanus led two expeditions against them, but his slow-moving infantry could not catch the speedy Turkish cavalry.
In 1070, Romanus led a second expedition towards Manzikert, offering a treaty to Alp Arslan, which was declined.
The Byzantine army, consisting of about 5000 troops from the western provinces and a similar number from the eastern provinces, along with mercenaries and other troops, marched towards Manzikert.
The march was long and difficult, with Romanus bringing a luxurious baggage train that did not endear him to his troops.
The army reached Theodosopolis in June of 1071, where some generals suggested continuing the march into Seljuk territory, while others suggested fortifying their position.
Eventually, they decided to continue the march.
Romanus, unaware of Alp Arslan's movements, marched towards Lake Van to retake Manzikert.
However, Alp Arslan was in Armenia with a large cavalry force.
The Byzantine army split, with one half under John Tarchaneiotes heading towards Khliat.
Tarchaneiotes' forces caught sight of the Seljuks and fled, not taking part in the battle.
Romanus captured Manzikert on August 23, but the Seljuks discovered his army the next day.
The Byzantines were attacked by Seljuk archers, and the battle ensued.
The Byzantine army was defeated, with Romanus being injured and taken prisoner.
Alp Arslan treated Romanus with kindness, offering him terms of peace, but Romanus was later deposed, blinded, and killed by his own subjects.
Despite the defeat, Byzantine casualties were relatively low, and the Turks did not pursue the fleeing Byzantines.
The defeat at Manzikert was seen as a disaster for the Byzantine Empire, leading to the decline of the empire and the eventual loss of Anatolia to the Seljuks.
The battle is considered one of the root causes for the later Crusades, as the West saw Byzantium as no longer capable of protecting Eastern Christianity.
Historians agree that the Battle of Manzikert marked the beginning of the decline of the Byzantine Empire.

The Byzantine-Sassanid War (602-628) was the final and most significant conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires.
The war began in 602 when Khosrau II invaded Byzantine territory in response to the execution of his ally, Emperor Maurice, by Phocas.
The Sassanids had early successes, capturing several frontier towns and cutting the Byzantine Empire in half by conquering Syria and Jerusalem.
In 618, the Sassanids captured Egypt, prompting Emperor Heraclius to raise a new army and take command himself.
Heraclius employed superior tactics and won several key battles, eventually forcing Khosrau to raise multiple armies to counter him.
In 626, the Sassanids attempted to invade Constantinople but were repelled by the Byzantine navy and the city's defenses.
Heraclius then formed an alliance with the Khazars (Turks) and invaded the Sassanid Empire, defeating Khosrau's forces at the Battle of Nineveh.
Khosrau was overthrown, and peace was eventually negotiated between the two empires.
The war had devastating consequences for both sides, with widespread destruction and loss of life.

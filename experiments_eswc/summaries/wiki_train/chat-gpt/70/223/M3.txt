The Byzantine Empire, also known as Byzantium or the Eastern Roman Empire, was the direct continuation of the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, centered on the capital of Constantinople.
The empire reached its height under the Macedonian emperors of the late 9th, 10th, and early 11th centuries, gaining control over various territories and defeating the Bulgarians.
One of its greatest achievements was the codification of Roman law during the reign of Justinian, resulting in the Corpus Juris Civilis.
Byzantine art was primarily created for spiritual purposes, with examples showcasing the culture's splendor and spirituality.
The empire's economic expansion was driven by Constantinople's role as a major center of consumption.
Despite emphasizing their Roman origins, the Byzantines gradually distanced themselves from their roots and were influenced by Hellenization and theocracy.
The empire played a key role in passing on classical and Near Eastern culture to Renaissance Italy and early modern Europe.
Constantine the Great, the empire's founder, is remembered for moving the seat of empire to Constantinople and embracing Christianity.
The Byzantine Empire lasted for over a thousand years, with its coinage found across various regions.
While the Western Roman Empire declined, Byzantium developed its own achievements in Roman law, preservation of Greek texts, and the spread of Christianity.

The Byzantine Empire, originating in 330 A.D. when Roman Emperor Constantine I established Constantinople as the new Roman capital, survived for 1,000 years after the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476.
The empire served as a military buffer between Europe and Asia, fostering a rich tradition of art, literature, and learning.
The empire finally fell in 1453 when the Ottoman army stormed Constantinople during the reign of Constantine XI.
The empire's survival was attributed to its geographic location, strong administrative center, internal political stability, and economic resources.
The empire was ruled by Roman law and institutions, with Latin as the official language, but Greek was widely spoken.
The Council of Chalcedon in 451 divided the Christian world into five patriarchates, with the Byzantine emperor serving as the patriarch of Constantinople.
Justinian I, ruling from 527 to 565, expanded the empire's territory, built monuments like the Hagia Sophia, and reformed Roman law.
However, his successors faced financial difficulties and struggled to maintain the empire's territory.
The empire faced threats from Persians, Slavs, and Islamic forces, losing territories like Syria, Egypt, and North Africa.
The empire experienced a golden age under the Macedonian dynasty in the late 10th and early 11th centuries, promoting arts, culture, and monasticism.
The Crusades in the 11th century strained relations between Byzantium and the West, culminating in the conquest and looting of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204.
The empire regained control in 1261 but faced economic decline and Ottoman oppression.
The final Ottoman conquest in 1453 marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, but its culture continued to influence Western intellectual tradition and countries practicing its Orthodox religion.

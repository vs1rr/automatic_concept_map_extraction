Justinian I, born around 482 CE in Illyria, was one of the most important late Roman and Byzantine emperors.
He reigned from 527 to 565 CE and is known for his military campaigns to retake Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Goths.
He also ordered the rebuilding of the Hagia Sophia church and completed the Codex Iustinianus, which brought together all Roman laws issued from Emperor Hadrian to the present.
Justinian's early life is not well-documented, but he was raised by his uncle Emperor Justin I and married Theodora, a woman from a poor background.
His military career began in the east with the Iberian War against the Sassanian Empire.
He successfully reconquered Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Goths, with the help of his military leader Belisarius.
However, the Gothic War continued with the rise of Totila, who managed to defeat Roman counter-attacks until he was finally defeated by Narses in 553 CE.
Justinian's reign was not without challenges, including revolts in Palestine and civil discontent in Constantinople.
He commissioned the Codex Iustinianus to compile Roman laws, and his life was recorded by Procopius in works that both praised and criticized his reign.
Justinian's achievements in art, architecture, legal reform, and conquest have solidified his legacy as one of the greatest emperors in late Roman and Byzantine history.

Chapter 7 of the text discusses Late Antiquity, specifically focusing on the Byzantine Empire from 350-600.
Despite efforts by Constantine and Justinian, the unity of the Roman Empire could not be maintained, and Byzantium faced assaults from various groups such as Germanic tribes, Persians, Huns, Bulgars, Avars, and Arabs.
The Byzantine Empire's strength came from strong military leadership, the fortifications of Constantinople, and the Law Code of Justinian, which was a significant contribution to European law.
Byzantine intellectual life passed on Greco-Roman culture to the Arabs and kept learning alive in the East.
In terms of science and medicine, Byzantines made advances in military uses but struggled with the Justinian plague.
The growth of the Christian Church saw the legalization of Christianity by Constantine, the Arian Heresy, and the development of Christian monasticism.
Christian ideas and practices absorbed classical culture, had notions of gender and sexuality, and were influenced by figures like St. Augustine.
Christian missionaries spread Christianity throughout Europe, including the British Isles and the Continent.
The idea of the barbarian was shaped by Greeks and Romans, and Germanic kingdoms were established between 450 and 565.
Anglo-Saxon England and the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy were significant developments during this time.
Germanic society was based on kinship, custom, and class, with laws written down in the late sixth century and a patriarchal social structure.

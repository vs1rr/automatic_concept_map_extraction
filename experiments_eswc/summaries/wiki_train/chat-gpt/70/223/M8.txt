Constantine the Great, a Roman Emperor from 272 to 337 AD, is best known for being the first Roman Emperor to embrace Christianity.
He rebuilt the city of Byzantium, renaming it Nova Roma (New Rome), and legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire through the Edict of Milan in 313.
Constantine's actions, including presiding over the Council of Nicaea in 325, played a significant role in the spread of Christianity.
Following Constantine's reign, the Byzantine Empire, centered around Constantinople, thrived as a major power for several years.
Emperors like Justinian, who ruled from 527 to 565, sought to reunite the old Roman Empire and implemented legal reforms such as Justinian's Code.
However, the empire began to decline after Justinian's death, facing invasions from various groups and ultimately falling to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.
The Byzantine Empire, influenced by Greek, Roman, and outside cultures, developed its own unique society.
The Byzantines interacted with various groups due to Constantinople's strategic location for trade, leading to a diverse society that reflected a mix of influences.
The Byzantine emperors held significant power, serving as both political and religious leaders, unlike their western counterparts.
Christianity was central to Byzantine life, with artists creating elaborate religious art and magnificent churches like the Hagia Sophia.
Despite differences in practices between Eastern and Western Christianity, leaders worked together until the Eastern Orthodox Church split from the rest of the church in the 1000s, leading to a complete division between eastern and western Europe.

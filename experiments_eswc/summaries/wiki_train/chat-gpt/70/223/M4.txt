Constantinople, also known as Byzantium, New Rome, and Istanbul, was the capital city of the Eastern Roman Empire after the fall of Rome.
It was founded by Constantine in the early fourth century, who enlarged the city and built defensive walls to protect it.
The city was strategically located on a promontory surrounded by water, with natural defenses on all sides except the side facing Europe, where walls were built.
The city had a valuable harbor in the bay called the Golden Horn.
The Theodosian walls, completed during the reign of Theodosius II, stretched 6.5 km from the Sea of Marmara to the Golden Horn, providing additional protection.
Constantinople was built on rocky terrain, similar to Rome, and claimed 7 hills.
The city was known for its forums, including those built by Constantine, Arcadius, Theodosius, Marcia, and Leo.

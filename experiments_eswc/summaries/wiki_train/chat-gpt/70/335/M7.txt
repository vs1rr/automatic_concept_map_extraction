Joe Hesketh, an artist, delves into the horrors of the Pendle Witch Trials through his art.
Growing up in Pendle, he felt like he was living in a Harry Potter film set, playing at making spells and perfumes.
Intrigued by the Pendle story, he embarked on a Pendle Investigation to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the trials.
Hesketh aims to shed light on the true story of injustice and portray the accused as healers rather than evil magicians.
The twelve accused of witchcraft were simple folk trying to survive, mostly poor, single women with different beliefs and an understanding of herbal medicines.
Hesketh walked the Purgatory Trail in 2011 to better understand the story, feeling the eerie presence of the witches along the way.
The impact of the trials is still felt in modern society, with references in bus routes, local pubs, and ales.
Despite some reluctance to discuss the trials, Hesketh's art aims to educate and bring a contemporary perspective to the violent story, resonating with his own experiences as a woman of Pendle.

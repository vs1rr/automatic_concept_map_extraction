In 1612, ten people were convicted of witchcraft at the Summer Assize in Lancaster Castle and were hanged on the moors above the town.
The accused, including two men and an elderly woman, were charged with crimes such as laming, causing madness, and "simple" witchcraft.
Additionally, sixteen unexplained deaths were attributed to them.
The story of the Pendle Witches began in the remote Pendle Forest in Lancashire, where the accused resided.
The trials, presided over by Sir Edward Bromley, involved testimonies from witnesses, including young Jennet Device, who implicated her family members in witchcraft.
Despite flimsy evidence, all the accused were found guilty and sentenced to death.
The trials were documented in Thomas Potts' book "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster," which highlighted the political and religious tensions of the time.
The Pendle Witch trials remain one of the most famous witchcraft trials in history, with ten individuals losing their lives due to accusations of witchcraft.

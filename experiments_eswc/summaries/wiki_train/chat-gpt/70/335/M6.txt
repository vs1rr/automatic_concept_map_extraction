The Pendle Witch Trials, part of the Lancashire Witch Trials, were among the most famous witch trials in English history in the 17th century.
The trials were well-documented by Thomas Potts in his book "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster."
The accused were from the Pendle Hill area in Lancashire, a region known for its lawlessness.
The trials began with a claim by a peddler against Alizon Device, who confessed to witchcraft.
This led to the implication of more family members and acquaintances, resulting in twelve people being accused of witchcraft and murder.
Ten of them were found guilty and executed, while one was acquitted.
The trials were known as the Lancashire Witch Trials.
Jennet Device, a key witness, later found herself accused of witchcraft as well.
In 1633-1634, another group of witches, including Margaret Johnson, were tried, but were able to appeal to the crown.
Despite Johnson's confession, they were found innocent after examination by doctors.
They were not executed but likely died in prison.
The later trials inspired a play and Pendle Hill remains associated with witchcraft, attracting tourists.

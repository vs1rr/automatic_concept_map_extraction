The Pendle Witch trials of 1612 were among the most famous in English history, with twelve accused of using witchcraft to murder ten people in Lancashire.
Nine women and two men were tried, with ten found guilty and executed.
The trials were documented in Thomas Potts' "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster."
The Pendle witches came from two families, with many accusations stemming from competition between them for a living.
The trials were unusual for England at the time, with more than two percent of all English witch trial executions attributed to them.
The outbreaks of witchcraft in Pendle highlight how people could profit from posing as witches.
The trials shed light on the competition and rivalry between families in the area, as well as the fear and superstition surrounding witchcraft during the 17th century.

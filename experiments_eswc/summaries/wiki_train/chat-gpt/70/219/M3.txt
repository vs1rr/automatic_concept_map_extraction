In the early 1930s, the discovery of neutron-induced fission in uranium sparked interest in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the potential military applications of this phenomenon.
Despite initial skepticism in official British circles, some research was initiated at universities to explore the theoretical aspects of achieving an explosive chain reaction.
Progress was slow, and resources were redirected to more pressing defense projects after the outbreak of World War II.


A breakthrough came in March 1940 with a memorandum by O. R. Frisch and R. E. Peierls, predicting the feasibility of a uranium bomb.
This led to the formation of the MAUD Committee, which commissioned research programs at various universities and industrial facilities.
By the end of 1940, the separation of uranium-235 and the production of plutonium-239 were shown to be feasible.


In the fall of 1940, the first official contact between American and British nuclear research occurred, leading to cooperation between the two countries.
By the spring of 1941, the MAUD Committee was convinced of the feasibility of a bomb and the potential for producing enriched uranium.
However, doubts about a plutonium bomb and the need for large resources for its development persisted.


The British produced reports on their work, which led to the establishment of the Directorate of Tube Alloys under the leadership of W. A. Akers and Sir John Anderson.
In the United States, a committee of physicists reviewed the uranium problem and concluded that a bomb was feasible, leading to an all-out development program endorsed by President Roosevelt.


Despite initial ambivalence and restrictions on information exchange, cooperation between the two countries resumed in 1943, culminating in the signing of the Quebec Agreement in August.
British scientists began working in the United States, contributing to various aspects of the Manhattan Project.


The British presence at Los Alamos and other facilities had a beneficial effect on morale and provided valuable expertise.
While the United States could have proceeded without British assistance, the collaboration significantly influenced the course of the British nuclear program in the postwar period.


The successful independent nuclear weapons program undertaken by the British postwar was a direct result of the wartime collaboration.
The similarities between the developments in nuclear weapons technology in both countries over the years highlight the enduring impact of the cooperation initiated during the Manhattan Project.


The story of the choice of the title "MAUD Committee" reflects the cryptic nature of wartime communications, with references to Maud Ray Kent eventually being identified as a former governess to Niels Bohr's children.
The collaboration on nuclear defense between the United States and the United Kingdom continues to be viewed as beneficial for the joint defense interests of both countries.

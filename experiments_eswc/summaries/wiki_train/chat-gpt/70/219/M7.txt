The Manhattan Project was a top-secret project during World War 2 that aimed to develop the atomic bomb.
The project was initiated after the discovery of nuclear fission in Uranium, which led to the realization that an atomic bomb was scientifically feasible.
The project was a joint effort between the United States and Britain, with the US Army Corps of Engineers leading the project in Manhattan, New York.
The project faced immense challenges, including acquiring large quantities of Uranium ore, developing methods for Uranium enrichment and Plutonium production, and designing the bomb mechanisms.
Over 130,000 people were employed for the project, which was kept entirely secret from the enemy.
The project successfully produced three atomic bombs, one of which was tested in July 1945, and the other two were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to the end of World War 2.
The project highlighted the immense destructive power of nuclear weapons and the need for global efforts to prevent their use in future conflicts.

The Manhattan Project was a top-secret American effort during World War II to produce the first atomic bomb.
It was initiated after Albert Einstein wrote a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt warning him that the Nazis may be developing their own atomic bombs.
The project involved key figures such as President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, as well as scientists like Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi.
The project was put into action in December 1941 and led to the testing and eventual dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in 1945, ultimately leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.
The Manhattan Project had a significant impact on the world, launching the nuclear age and influencing the future development of atomic weapons globally.

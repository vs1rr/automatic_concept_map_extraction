The Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II.
Led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada, the project began in 1939 and lasted until 1946.
Major General Leslie Groves of the US Army Corps of Engineers directed the project, which absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys.
The project employed over 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion.
Two types of atomic bombs were developed: a gun-type fission weapon using uranium-235 and an implosion-type nuclear weapon using plutonium.
The timeline of the Manhattan Project includes events such as the creation of the Advisory Committee on Uranium, the establishment of the Manhattan Engineering District, the first nuclear reactor going critical at the University of Chicago, the Trinity nuclear test, and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The project officially ended in 1947 with the formation of the United States Atomic Energy Commission.

This leads him to realize that implosion is the only viable method for a plutonium bomb.
The episode also highlights the moral dilemma faced by the scientists, particularly in light of the Nazi persecution of Jews in Europe.
The British Mission, which played a crucial role in the Manhattan Project, is introduced, adding to the complexity of the scientific efforts.
The episode also explores the role of women at Los Alamos and the challenges they faced in contributing to the project.
Overall, the episode sets the stage for further developments in the race to develop the atomic bomb and the personal struggles of the scientists involved.

The Los Alamos Historical Society recently hosted a viewing and discussion of the eighth episode of WGN's Manhattan, a series that fictionalizes life in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project.
The event had a great turnout, with community members and friends gathering at Time Out Pizzeria to watch and discuss the show.
The episode, titled "The Second Coming," delved into various aspects of the Manhattan Project, including the involvement of British scientists, the decision not to build the Thin Man bomb, and the horrors of World War II in Europe.


One of the key points discussed during the event was the role of British scientists in the Manhattan Project.
The British Mission, a group of scientists who had been working on implosion technology in Europe, came to Los Alamos to contribute to the project.
Led by Professor James Chadwick, the British team provided invaluable expertise that was essential to the success of the project.
The collaboration between American and British scientists was a crucial aspect of the Manhattan Project, as outlined in the Quebec Agreement signed by Roosevelt and Churchill in 1943.


Another topic of discussion was the decision not to build the Thin Man bomb, a gun-type plutonium bomb.
The episode highlighted the experimental discovery that reactor-produced plutonium had higher levels of Pu-240, making it more prone to predetonation.
This finding, made by Emilio Segrè and his group in 1944, led to the realization that a gun-type bomb made with reactor plutonium was not feasible.
The episode also touched on the challenges of implosion bomb research, which was initially considered a backup design until the flaws in the Thin Man bomb were discovered.


The episode also brought attention to the atrocities of World War II, particularly in the city of Minsk.
The city, which was part of the USSR during the war, suffered heavy bombing and destruction, with a large portion of its population killed or displaced.
Minsk was also the site of a Nazi-run ghetto that held over 100,000 Jews, many of whom were killed during the war.
The episode highlighted the horrors of the Holocaust and the impact of the war on European cities like Minsk.


Throughout the event, various references were made to notable figures and works of literature.
Schrödinger's cat, a thought experiment in quantum mechanics, was mentioned in relation to the concept of particles existing in multiple states simultaneously.
Additionally, quotes from William Butler Yeats' "Second Coming" and Virginia Woolf were used to illustrate themes of uncertainty and the need for independence.


Overall, the discussion of the eighth episode of Manhattan provided insight into the historical context of the Manhattan Project and the impact of World War II on both scientific advancements and human suffering.
The event served as an opportunity for community members to come together, learn, and reflect on the complex history of this pivotal period in American and world history.

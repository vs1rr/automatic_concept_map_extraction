Otto Robert Frisch was an Austrian-British physicist born in Vienna in 1904.
He studied at the University of Vienna and worked in various laboratories in Germany before moving to London in 1933 due to the political situation in Germany.
In 1938, he, along with his aunt Lise Meitner, discovered nuclear fission, which led to the development of atomic bombs.
During World War II, Frisch worked on the Manhattan Project in the United States, where he played a key role in determining the critical mass of enriched uranium needed for the atomic bomb.
After the war, he returned to England and continued his work in nuclear physics.
Frisch retired in 1972 and passed away in 1979.
He is known for his contributions to atomic physics and his work on nuclear fission.

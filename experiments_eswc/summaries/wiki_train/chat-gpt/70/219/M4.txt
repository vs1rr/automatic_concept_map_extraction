In 1939, Albert Einstein wrote a letter to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt warning about the potential of atomic bombs being developed by the Germans.
With the help of physicist Leo Szilard, Einstein urged the United States to start researching atomic energy.
Roosevelt initially hesitated due to funding concerns but eventually established a committee to study uranium.
This decision led to the creation of the Manhattan Project, the successful atomic bomb effort during World War II.


The British, who made early theoretical contributions, lacked the resources to pursue atomic bomb research while fighting in the war.
They reluctantly deferred to American leadership and sent scientists to work on the Manhattan Project.
The Germans, despite Allied fears, were not close to developing atomic weapons by the end of the war.
The Russians and Japanese also had atomic bomb research programs, but they were not as successful as the Manhattan Project.


The Manhattan Project, led by the United States, was the only effort that successfully developed an atomic bomb during World War II.
The Americans, protected by oceans on both sides, were able to take the discovery of fission from the laboratory to the battlefield and gain a temporary atomic monopoly.
The project's success was a result of Roosevelt's decision to pursue atomic energy research based on Einstein's warning about the potential of atomic bombs.


Overall, the Manhattan Project was a crucial initiative that ultimately led to the development of the atomic bomb, which played a significant role in ending World War II.
The project's success was a result of American leadership, resources, and determination to prevent other countries, particularly Germany, from gaining control of powerful atomic weapons.
The Manhattan Project's impact on history is undeniable, as it marked the beginning of the atomic age and changed the course of warfare forever.

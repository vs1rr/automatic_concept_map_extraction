Bellmans Auctioneers will be selling some of the contents of Bramshill House, the former Police Training College in Hampshire, in May 2015.
The collection includes unique pieces from the historic house, which was built in the early 17th century and has a rich history, including being the residence of King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania.
The house was designated a Grade I listed building in 1952 and was later acquired by the Home Office.
Due to escalating maintenance costs, the property was sold to heritage property developers in 2014.
Bellmans has been chosen to auction some of the contents of Bramshill House, with pieces denoted in the catalogue with a police helmet image.
Notable items include a massive elm and oak refectory table, oak triple sconce candelabras by Robert 'Mouseman' Thompson, and oak ceremonial armchairs commissioned for Her Majesty the Queen and HRH Prince Phillip.
The auction will be held over four days in May at Bellmans' West Sussex Saleroom, with online bidding available.
Bellmans Saleroom Manager Will Pasfield is excited to oversee the auction process and highlights the unique pieces from Bramshill House, such as the elm topped refectory table.
The entire auction will be on view from midday on Friday 15th May, with online bidding available via the-saleroom.com.

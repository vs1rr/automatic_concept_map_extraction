The Bramshill, a prestigious Police College in Britain, is known for being haunted by multiple spirits, including the White Lady, the Grey Lady, the Green Man, and others.
The White Lady, believed to be a young bride who got entombed in a mistletoe-bough chest, is said to announce her presence with a floral fragrance.
The Grey Lady wanders the mansion in search of her husband, while the Green Man is seen near the fresh water-lake.
Other ghosts, such as Ronald and the old man with a long beard, also haunt the mansion.
The College Secretariat keeps a 'ghost file' to record encounters with these spirits.
The Bramshill is considered the 'most haunted house in Hampshire', with most of the ghosts being described as friendly or non-harmful.
Visitors are encouraged to share their ghostly experiences to be added to the ghost file.

City & Country, a renowned heritage developer, has acquired Bramshill, a significant Jacobean Prodigy House in Britain.
The Grade I Listed mansion, built in the early 17th Century, features majestic state rooms, banquet halls, a library, and two chapels.
The property also includes Grade I Listed walled gardens, a historic deer park, and a lake with a geometric island.
The acquisition was praised by Helen Moore, Managing Director of City & Country, who highlighted the importance of preserving the historic asset.
The Home Office, which previously used the property for training, made the decision to sell Bramshill to generate funding and allow for its restoration by City & Country.


Bramshill has a rich history dating back to the Domesday Book of 1086.
The mansion as it stands today is largely attributed to Edward, 11th Lord Zouche of Harringworth, who reconstructed the property in the early 17th Century.
The estate has exchanged hands between various owners over the centuries, including the Cope family who owned it for 236 years.
During the Second World War, Bramshill served as a Red Cross facility and later as a home for the exiled King of Romania.
In 1953, the Home Office purchased the estate and used it as a Police Training college from 1960 onwards.


The mansion's location in Hampshire offers easy access to London with regular rail services and proximity to major motorways and airports.
City & Country, with over 50 years of experience in restoring historic sites, has a track record of creating outstanding heritage and new build homes.
The company has successfully launched projects such as The General in Bristol city centre and the King Edward VII Estate in the South Downs National Park.


The acquisition of Bramshill by City & Country has been praised by Emma Cleugh, Head of Institutional Consultancy at Knight Frank, as a significant sale for Hampshire.
The expertise and track record of City & Country in dealing with precious heritage assets were key factors in securing the acquisition.
The company's commitment to restoring and preserving historic sites like Bramshill ensures that these valuable heritage assets are revived and extended for future generations to enjoy.

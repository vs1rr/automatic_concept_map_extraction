Jacobean architecture, prevalent during the reigns of King James I and VI and Charles I in England, was a blend of Flemish, French, and Italian Renaissance influences.
It featured jewelled strapwork, grotesque ornamentation, and elements like Orders, emblems, and obelisks.
While Gothic influences like mullioned windows persisted, the style also incorporated curved and Dutch gables.
Notable examples include Hatfield House, Bramshill, and Audley End.
Inigo Jones, known for his Italian style, made contributions during this period but is not considered Jacobean.
A revival of Jacobean architecture occurred in the 19th century, often mixed with the Queen Anne style, resulting in unique hybrids like R. N. Shaw's New Zealand Chambers.
Various sources provide insight into Jacobean architecture, including works by Airs, Cruickshank, Lampugnani, Mowl, and Summerson.
Overall, Jacobean architecture was a rich and eclectic style that left a lasting impact

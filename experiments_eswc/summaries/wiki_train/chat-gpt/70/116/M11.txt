Bramshill House, built in the early 17th century for Lord Zouche of Harringworth, is now a police staff training college.
The Jacobean-style house features symmetrical elevations, a narrow interior court, and a red-tiled roof with hipped and gabled sections.
The house is constructed from red brick with stone dressings, including a balustrade parapet, detailed windows, and an elaborate entrance.
The south entrance front includes a three-story stone porch and flanking wings added in 1703.
In 1960, Bramshill House became the principal police staff training college in the UK, and in 2007, it also housed part of the National Policing Improvement Agency.
A refurbishment program began in 2009 and is set to be completed in 2014.
The house retains some original features, such as incorporated remains of an earlier house in the east wing.
Today, Bramshill House

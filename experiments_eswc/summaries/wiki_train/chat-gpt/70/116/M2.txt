Bramshill House is a Jacobean mansion located in Hampshire, England, on 269 acres of land.
It has been the Police Staff College since 1955.
The history of Bramshill dates back to Saxon times, with Thomas Foxley rebuilding Windsor Castle in the 14th century.
Edward Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche of Harringworth, bought the property in 1605 and completed the construction of the current house in 1612.
The house includes a chapel and a priest's hole.
In 1622, Archbishop George Abbot accidentally killed a keeper while hunting in the park.
The property was later owned by the Cope family until 1935, who demolished the chapel in the 18th century.
After World War II, King Michael and Queen Ana of Romania lived at Bramshill.
The house also has a cricket ground that hosted four first-class matches in the 19th century.
Today, a cricket ground still exists on the site of the house.

MEP Marta Andreasen is calling for the closure of the European Police College (Cepol) near Hook due to alleged abuses of EU funding.
The Budgetary Control Committee refused to sign off on Cepol's accounts for 2008 after it was revealed that EU money had been used for personal items such as furniture and mobile phones.
Andreasen believes that the college, which educates policemen, should be held to high ethical standards and that using EU funding for personal purposes raises concerns about the college's integrity.
Cepol, which was established in 2006 at Bramshill House, currently receives 8 million euros a year from the EU to provide training for police officers from across Europe.
However, concerns about spending practices have led to the European Parliament refusing to approve the college's accounts for two consecutive years.
The issue will now be brought before the full European Parliament for a decision.
Andreasen's recommendation is for the college to be shut down in light of the alleged funding abuses.

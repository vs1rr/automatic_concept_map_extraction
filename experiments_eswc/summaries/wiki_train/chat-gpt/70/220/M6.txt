The East India Company was a key player in the formation of the British Empire, initially established as a trading post in Java but expanding to secure trading posts in India due to competition from other European powers.
The company bought land from Indian rulers, established its own army and navy, and became the dominant power in India.
It developed trade routes that brought significant cultural and economic changes to Britain, with tea from China becoming a key import.
The company's armed forces played a surprising role in representing British interests, as illustrated during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 when many Indians rebelled against British authority.
The rebellion led to immense human suffering and the dissolution of the East India Company in 1858, with the administration of India then becoming the responsibility of the Crown.
This historical event marked the end of the East India Company's influence in India and the transition to direct British rule.

A protectorate is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state.
In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly depending on the real nature of their relationship.
Protectorates are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of.
A state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates.
Protectorates can be established for various reasons, including moral obligations, countering rival powers, or maintaining control of strategic areas.
Protectorates often have direct foreign relations only with the protecting power and rely on the protector for defense.
Protectorates differ from League of Nations Mandates and their successors, United Nations Trust Territories, whose administration is supervised by the international community.
Examples of protectorates include British protectorates in various regions such as Africa, Asia, and Oceania, as well as French protectorates in regions like the Arab world and Madagascar.
Other countries, such as the United States and Italy, have also established protectorates in different parts of the world.
The concept of protectorates continues to be relevant in contemporary international relations, with some territories still being considered protectorates by countries like the United States.

The British Empire was the largest empire in history, spanning a quarter of the world and making the United Kingdom the most powerful country for over a century.
It began in the 17th century and lasted until the mid-20th century, consisting of dominions, colonies, protectorates, and mandates ruled by the United Kingdom.
By the 1920s, the empire had 458 million people, a fifth of the world's population, and covered a quarter of the Earth's land surface.
The empire was known as 'the empire on which the sun never sets' due to its vast reach across the globe, leaving a lasting British influence on many parts of the world, including the widespread use of English as an international language.


The British Empire was not the first to engage in imperialism, with the Portuguese and Spanish preceding them in acquiring vast territories in the Americas.
Queen Elizabeth I recognized the importance of colonization for England's strength and wealth, leading to England's involvement in the race for empire-building.
England, along with France and the Netherlands, established colonies and trade networks, leading to conflicts between the empires.
By the 17th and 18th centuries, England emerged as the main colonial power in North America and India after defeating France and the Netherlands.


However, the empire faced challenges, such as the loss of the American colonies in the late 18th century, prompting Britain to focus on other regions like Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.
The decline of Spain, the defeat of Napoleon, and the expansion of the United States further facilitated Britain's imperial expansion.
The empire evolved into self-governing dominions, reaching its peak influence at the start of the 20th century.


The empire suffered setbacks during the two world wars, draining Britain financially and allowing the United States to rise as a powerful industrial nation.
After World War II, Britain was unable to maintain control over its colonies, leading to a wave of independence movements in countries like India and Africa.
India gained independence in 1947, followed by African nations in the 1960s.
The decolonization process revealed underlying tensions within the empire, leading to divisions like the split between India and Pakistan.


Despite the dissolution of the empire, many former colonies chose to remain part of the Commonwealth, with sixteen nations sharing Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state.
The legacy of the British Empire continues to influence global politics, economics, and culture, shaping the modern world in various ways.

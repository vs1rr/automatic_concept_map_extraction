The text discusses why Great Britain had the best and most infantry, attributing it to the abundance of valuable resources in other parts of the world, particularly in agriculture.
This allowed for more food production, which in turn led to a larger army.
France, on the other hand, did not prioritize colonial empires as they were already wealthy enough to sustain a large army without them.
Despite this, France did have a colonial empire, although smaller in comparison to the British Empire.
The text also mentions that both French kings and Napol√©on did not see colonies as essential, but history proved them wrong.

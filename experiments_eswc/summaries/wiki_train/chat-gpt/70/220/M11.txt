The British Empire was the largest empire in human history, lasting nearly half a millennia and reaching its height as the foremost power in the world by the turn of the 20th century.
The empire covered 13,012,000 square miles and governed 458 million people, a full fifth of the world's population.
The empire's origins can be traced back to the late 15th century when England began to invest in trans-oceanic exploration and trade.
English navigators like John Hopkins and Francis Drake played key roles in challenging the Iberian monopoly on trans-Atlantic trade and raiding Spanish vessels and settlements for wealth.
The 17th century saw the colonization process begin in earnest under James I, with the establishment of chartered companies exploiting resources in North America and the Caribbean.
The 18th century saw Britain triumph over European rivals and achieve naval supremacy, leading to increased urbanization and emigration to British colonies in North America.
The 19th century saw the Royal Navy become a global leader in maritime technology, with Britain producing goods on a massive scale for colonial and foreign markets.
The century also saw the abolition of slavery throughout the empire and the expansion of British control in Asia and Africa.
The 20th century saw the empire's decline, with Britain dismantling its colonies in response to global shifts in power and decolonization movements.
The legacy of the British Empire includes the spread of the English language, parliamentary system of government, and common law, as well as significant demographic changes through migration within and from the empire.

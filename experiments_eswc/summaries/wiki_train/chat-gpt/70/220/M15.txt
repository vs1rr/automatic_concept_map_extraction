The British Empire, also known as "the empire on which the sun never sets," sought to expand its territory in India for economic gain, spreading Christianity, increasing global power, and a belief in their superiority.
They were able to conquer India due to their strong navy, advanced weaponry, and efficient organization.
Before British imperialism, India was a collection of separate kingdoms with no unified political entity.

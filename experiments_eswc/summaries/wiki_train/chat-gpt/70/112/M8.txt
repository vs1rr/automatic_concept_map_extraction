The Old Library in Dublin, Ireland is home to the Book of Kells, a famous illuminated manuscript dating back to around 800 AD.
The library also displays pages from other ancient works such as the Book of Armagh and the Book of Mulling.
The Book of Kells is known for its intricate decoration and is believed to have originated from the monastery on Iona, founded by St Colmcille.

The manuscript contains the four New Testament gospels and is decorated with a variety of influences including Pictish, Germanic, Mediterranean, and Celtic.
The Long Room in the library, built in the 18th century, houses a vast collection of books and historical artifacts, including a fifteenth-century harp and an original printing of the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic.
Trinity College, where the Old Library is located, has been a copyright library since 1801 and holds a significant collection of British and Irish publications.
The library also hosts temporary exhibitions showcasing its collection of books and prints.
Overall, the Old Library and the Book of Kells are a must-see attraction for tourists visiting Dublin, offering a glimpse into Ireland's rich literary and artistic history.

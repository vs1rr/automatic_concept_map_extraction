The Book of Kells, also known as the Book of Columba, is a famous illuminated manuscript created by Celtic monks around AD 800 in the style of Insular art.
It is named after the Abbey of Kells in Ireland, where it was kept for much of the medieval period.
The exact date and place of production of the manuscript have been debated, with theories suggesting it was created at Iona and finished at Kells, or entirely at Kells, among others.
The book contains the four gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, along with prefaces, summaries, and concordances of gospel passages.
The manuscript consists of 340 folios, with some folios lost over time.
The text is based on the Vulgate but contains numerous variants, suggesting the scribes may have relied on memory rather than the exemplar.
The manuscript is written in Insular majuscule, with intricate full-page artwork and smaller painted decorations throughout.
The lavish illumination program includes ten full-page illuminations, 13 full pages of decorated text, and numerous smaller decorations and initials.
The book is in remarkably good condition considering its age, with some damage to delicate artwork.

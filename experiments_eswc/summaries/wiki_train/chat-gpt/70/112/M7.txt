The Book of Kells is a religious manuscript containing the four gospels, but it is also considered a masterpiece of Celtic art and one of the most important treasures of Western Europe.
It was possibly begun on the Isle of Iona and later moved to Kells Monastery in Ireland for protection during Viking raids.
The book was stolen in 1007, but recovered with some water damage and its cover forever lost.
It remained at Kells Monastery until 1541 when it was taken by the Roman Catholic Church for protection.
In 1661, it was returned to Ireland and given to Trinity College of Dublin, where it remains today.
Approximately 30 pages have been lost over the years, but the remaining 340 pages contain intricate artwork covering a variety of styles.
It is estimated that a team of illustrators took thirty years to complete the artwork, which is meticulously done by hand in amazing intricacy and color.
The most impressive pages open the four chapters with illustrations of saints and events in the life of Christ.
The detail in the Book of Kells is extraordinary, with no duplicated symbols and over 158 lacings of a white ribbon in a square inch.
Despite the complexity of the artwork, there are no errors to be found, even under a magnifying glass.
The level of detail and precision in the Book of Kells led many to believe that only angels could have been responsible for its creation.

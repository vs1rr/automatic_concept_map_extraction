The Book of Kells is a highly revered manuscript containing 678 illustrated pages made of calf-skin or vellum.
The majority of the book was likely written in the Columban Monastery's scriptorum on the island of Iona in Scotland and colored using natural dyes made by monks.
The ink used in the book has not faded in over 1000 years.
While many believe that the four symbols in the book represent the four Apostles, they actually represent the Twelve Tribes of Israel, with each symbol corresponding to a specific tribe.
The Irish people are said to be mostly descended from the Tribe of Dan, one of Jacob/Israel's twelve sons.
The Tuatha de Danaan, also known as the Tribe of Dan, migrated to Ireland from Carthage, which was a Phoenician Danite settlement.
The Book of Kells features the four tribal standards mentioned in Christ's Apocalypse/Revelation, further emphasizing the connection between the Irish people and the tribes of Israel.
James, the Lord's brother, later wrote to all twelve tribes of Israel in his letter in the New Testament.
The Book of Kells holds significant historical and cultural importance, showcasing the intricate connections between the Irish people and the ancient tribes of Israel.

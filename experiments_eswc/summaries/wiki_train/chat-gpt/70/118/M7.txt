The Brougham Roman fort (Brocavum) and civil settlement, along with Brougham Castle, are designated as scheduled monuments under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.
The fort was constructed during the Roman occupation of Britain and was associated with a civilian settlement that developed around it in the 3rd century.
The fort was strategically located at the junction of main Roman roads and was dedicated to the local deity Belatucadrus.
The castle was built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vieuxpont and later expanded by the Clifford family.
Lady Anne Clifford made significant renovations to the castle in the 17th century, transforming it into a country seat.
The castle eventually fell into ruin and was consolidated in the 20th century.


Archaeological investigations have revealed the well-preserved remains of the Roman fort and associated settlement, as well as the medieval castle.
Excavations have uncovered structures, roads, ditches, and burials dating back to the Roman period.
The castle's layout and defensive features have also been studied through archaeological surveys.
The monument is divided into three separate areas, each containing different components of the fort, settlement, and castle.
The extent of the scheduling includes the upstanding and buried remains of the fort, vicus, and castle, with specific exclusions for modern features such as field boundaries and gates.


Overall, the Brougham Roman fort, civil settlement, and Brougham Castle are of national importance due to their well-preserved archaeological remains, historical significance, and potential for further research.
The site provides valuable insights into Roman and medieval military occupation and settlement in northern England, as well as responses to threats from the north during these periods.
The castle's development over the centuries, from a strategic border defense to a country residence, reflects the changing political and social landscape of the region.

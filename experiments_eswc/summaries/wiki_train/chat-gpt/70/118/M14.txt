Brough Castle, located on the edge of Brough and overlooking the A66, is a historic site dating back to 1090.
Built on the ruins of a Roman fort called Verteris, the castle was initially constructed by William Rufus as a defense against the Scots.
It was later taken by the Scots in 1136 and held until 1157 when it was recaptured by the English.
The castle was besieged by the Scottish king in 1173/4 and eventually surrendered after valiant efforts by its defenders.
Much of the castle was destroyed by the Scottish army, but some parts, including the outer walls and the base of the keep, remained intact.


Restoration work was carried out on the castle between 1179 and 1190 by Theobold de Valoines, and major renovations were done in 1203 by Robert de Vipont.
The Clifford family took ownership of the castle in 1269 and made further additions, including Cliffords Tower and a new hall.
However, in 1521, a great fire destroyed much of the castle during Christmas feasts.
Lady Anne Clifford took an interest in the castle in 1661 and started restoration works, which continued after her death in 1679.


The castle eventually fell into disrepair, with stone being taken to repair other buildings.
In 1920, the castle was passed to the Ministry of Works and is now cared for by English Heritage.
Visitors can enter the castle for free and it is open all the time.
The castle's location is 8 miles southeast of Appleby, south of the A66.
It is accessible by train and bus, with the nearest train station being Kirkby Stephen, 6 miles away.
The castle's history, from its Roman origins to its various owners and restoration efforts, make it a significant historical site in the region.

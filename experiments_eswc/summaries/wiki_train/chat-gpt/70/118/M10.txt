Brougham Castle in Cumbria was built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vieuxpont, strategically located between the rivers Lowther and Eamont.
The castle passed through various owners, including the de Clifford family, who improved its defenses during the Anglo-Scottish War.
The castle was briefly captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388, leading the de Cliffords to prefer Skipton Castle in Yorkshire.
By 1592, Brougham Castle was in disrepair under the ownership of Sir George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland.
It underwent a brief restoration in the early 17th century, hosting James I in 1617.
Lady Anne Clifford inherited the castle in 1643 and oversaw a period of restoration at Brougham and other family castles.
She died in 1676, after which the castle fell into ruin under the ownership of the Lord of Thanet.
In the 1930s, Brougham Castle passed into state ownership and is now managed by English Heritage, open to the public.

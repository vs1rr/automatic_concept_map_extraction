Lady Anne Clifford was a remarkable woman who fought for 40 years to regain her inheritance and spent the rest of her life restoring the Clifford castles and churches to their former glory.
She was the last of a long line of Lancastrians and held the titles of Countess Dowager of Dorset and of Pembroke.
Lady Anne restored several castles including Brougham, Appleby, Brough, Pendragon, and Skipton, as well as rebuilding churches such as St Ninian’s and St Wilfred’s.
Upon her death in 1676, Brougham Castle passed to her grandson, who dismantled it, leading to its ruin until it was rescued by the Ministry of Works in 1928 and is now in the care of English Heritage.
Lady Anne also erected the Countess Pillar to commemorate her last parting from her mother in 1616 and made provisions for money to be distributed to the poor every year on April 2 at the Countess Pillar.
Lady Anne Clifford's legacy lives on in the restored castles and churches she worked tirelessly to preserve, as well as in the annual ceremony at the Countess Pillar.

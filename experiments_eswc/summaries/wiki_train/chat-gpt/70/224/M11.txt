In 1854, Stephen Spencer Hill, a slave, escaped from his owner, Owen R. Rozier, in California during the Gold Rush.
Rozier accused Hill of stealing his watch and cash, but Hill's white neighbors, known as the Gold Spring Boys, helped him escape as they did not believe he was Rozier's property.
Despite California being a free state, federal laws allowed for the capture and return of fugitive slaves.
Hill did not have the necessary paperwork to prove his freedom, and a judge ruled in Rozier's favor.
Slavery was not popular in the mines, but there were no laws against it in the early days of the Gold Rush.
California eventually joined the Union as a free state in 1849, tipping the balance between free and slave states.
The Compromise of 1850 was reached, allowing California to enter the Union under the terms of the state delegates.
However, civil rights were not extended to African Americans or Native Americans in California, as they were denied the right to vote and testify in court.
California also passed its own version of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1852, allowing white slave owners to reclaim escaped black slaves.

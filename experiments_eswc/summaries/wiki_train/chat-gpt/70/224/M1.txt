The Gold Rush of 1849 was sparked by the discovery of gold nuggets in the Sacramento Valley, leading to a significant influx of prospectors to the California territory.
By the end of 1849, the non-native population had grown to 100,000 from less than 1,000 before the discovery.
The total value of precious metal extracted during the Gold Rush was $2 billion, with the peak occurring in 1852.
The discovery of gold was made by James Wilson Marshall on January 24, 1848, while working on a water-powered sawmill owned by John Sutter near Coloma, California.
Marshall's discovery led to a rush of people seeking their fortunes in gold mining, shaping American history in the first half of the 19th century.

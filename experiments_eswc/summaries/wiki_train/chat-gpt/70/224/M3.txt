The California Gold Rush was a period of mass hysteria and migration in American history, sparked by the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848.
Despite the influx of people seeking fortune, most only found enough gold to cover daily expenses.
The rush led to the development of California and the building of the Panama Railway.
San Francisco initially became a ghost town as people left to mine for gold, but later boomed as miners returned looking for work.
The sudden influx of people strained infrastructure and led to an increase in crime, prompting vigilantes to rise up.
The Gold Rush is considered to have ended in 1858 with the start of the New Mexican Gold Rush.
The San Francisco 49ers NFL team is named after the prospectors of the California Gold Rush.

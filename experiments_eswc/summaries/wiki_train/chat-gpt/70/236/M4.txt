On September 7, 1822, Dom Pedro I declared independence in the Grito de Ipiranga, liberating Brazil from Portugal.
Throughout the colonial period, Portugal had neglected Brazil, focusing instead on other profitable ventures.
The Portuguese Crown controlled Brazil through resource extraction and strict decrees, prohibiting trade with foreign powers.
However, with Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 1808, the Portuguese court relocated to Rio de Janeiro, making Brazil the seat of the Portuguese Empire.
This shift led to a period of growth and cultural development in Brazil.
When Jo√£o VI returned to Portugal in 1821, his son Pedro I remained in Brazil as regent.
As Portuguese elites attempted to reassert control over the colony, Brazilian elites resisted.
On September 7, 1822, Pedro I formally declared independence from Portugal, allegedly proclaiming "Independence or Death!"
Despite the heroic portrayal of the declaration, Pedro I was reportedly suffering from diarrhea at the time.
Portugal offered no resistance, and Brazil peacefully gained independence, becoming the only monarchy in Latin America after independence.

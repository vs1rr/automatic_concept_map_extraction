The history of Brazilian law can be traced back to the early 19th century, with the drafting and adoption of the 1824 Constitution following Brazil's independence from Portugal.
This Constitution established a constitutional monarchy with Emperor Pedro I at the helm, incorporating elements of both French and North American political models.
The Constitution also introduced the concept of the Poder Moderador, a unique fourth branch of government aimed at maintaining stability and national identity.
Over the next six decades, Brazil saw the enactment of various statutes, including the Criminal Code in 1830 and the Commercial Code in 1850, but no Civil Code was passed during this period.
The reign of Pedro I and Pedro II, as well as the abolition of slavery in 1888, marked significant milestones during this time.


In 1889, Pedro II was forced into exile, leading to the establishment of the Republic of Brazil and the drafting of the 1891 Constitution.
Modeled after the U.S. Constitution, the 1891 Constitution introduced federalism, a republican government, and a presidential system.
It also abolished the Poder Moderador and decentralized political power, establishing a system of checks and balances among the branches of government.
The Constitution of 1891 aimed to promote liberal democratic ideals and ensure progressive development in line with the North American model.


The 1930 Revolution and subsequent Constitution of 1934 reflected a shift towards social law and democratic principles, including provisions for family, education, and social realignment of the economy.
The Constitution of 1934 also granted women the right to vote and established Labor Courts and Electoral Courts.
However, this Constitution was short-lived, as the authoritarian Constitution of 1937, known as the Estado Novo, concentrated power in the hands of President Get√∫lio Vargas and restricted individual rights.


The 1946 Constitution, enacted after World War II, reinstated basic individual rights and established a true separation of powers.
However, the military coup of 1964 led to a series of amendments that undermined the democratic character of the Constitution.
The 1967 Constitution further centralized power in the hands of the President, institutionalizing the military regime and limiting the role of the legislative and judicial branches.
The 1969 Constitution, enacted through an amendment, intensified the concentration of power in the executive and further restricted civil liberties.


The 1988 Constitution, known as the "Citizens' Constitution," marked a transition from authoritarian rule to democracy in Brazil.
Enacted by the National Constituent Assembly, the 1988 Constitution established a presidential government and ensured that chief executives were elected by the people.
This Constitution has provided Brazil with a period of institutional stability and is characterized by the prevalence of principles over rules, emphasizing justice and ethical practices.
The right of access to justice is enshrined in the Constitution, reflecting a commitment to fairness and effectiveness in legal proceedings.

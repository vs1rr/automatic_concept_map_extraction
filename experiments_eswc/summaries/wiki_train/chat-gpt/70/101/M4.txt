7 World Trade Center is a building in Lower Manhattan, New York City, that was originally completed in 1987 and destroyed in the September 11 attacks.
The current building, developed by Larry Silverstein, opened in 2006.
The original building had difficulties attracting tenants until Salomon Brothers signed a long-term lease in 1988.
On September 11, 2001, the building was damaged by debris from the nearby North Tower collapse and subsequently collapsed due to uncontrolled fires, making it the first tall building to collapse primarily due to fire.
The new building, completed in 2006, is taller and built on a smaller footprint than the original.
It emphasizes safety with a reinforced concrete core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing of steel columns.
The design also includes green features, leading to LEED certification.
The building is bounded by Greenwich, Vesey, Washington, and Barclay streets, with a small park across Greenwich Street occupying part of the original building's footprint.
The construction of the new Trade Center began in 2002 and was completed in 2006, making it the 28th-tallest building in New York City.
The building's design and construction prioritize safety and sustainability, making it one of the first commercial office buildings in New York City to receive LEED certification.

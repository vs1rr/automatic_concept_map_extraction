The Borobudur Temple Compound in Indonesia is a significant monument that showcases the country's pre-Islamic history dominated by Hinduism and Buddhism.
Built in the 8th and 9th centuries by the Sailendra dynasty, Borobudur is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, featuring intricate low reliefs depicting Buddhist scenes.
Abandoned by the 16th century due to the shift of Javan life to the eastern part of the island with the arrival of Islam, Borobudur was left to decay and covered by volcanic ash and vegetation.
In the 19th century, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles initiated an excavation of the temple, leading to further deterioration as stones were removed and treasures were stolen.
In 1948, the Indonesian government took steps to preserve Borobudur, launching the "Save Borobudur" campaign in collaboration with UNESCO.
The restoration project, completed after eight years and $25 million, involved dismantling the lower terraces to clean and treat each stone individually, as well as cleaning and treating the relief panels.
An extensive drainage system was also installed to reduce erosion.
Despite ongoing conservation efforts, Borobudur faced threats such as the eruption of Mount Kelud, prompting protective measures to safeguard the temple.
The preservation of Borobudur in a predominantly Muslim country highlights its cultural and historical significance as an iconic monument of Indonesia.

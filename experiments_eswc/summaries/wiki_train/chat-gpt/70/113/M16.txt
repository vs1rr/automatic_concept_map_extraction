Indonesian police have increased security at the Borobudur Temple, the world's largest Buddhist temple and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, after a threat was made by Islamic State supporters on Facebook.
The threat, posted on August 15, stated that the temple would be demolished by Islamic caliphate mujahidin.
In response, police in Central Java province have been searching for clues online and working with temple security and the Indonesian Military to protect the site.
The Borobudur Conservation Agency has also increased security personnel in and around the temple, with support from the Indonesian army.
Borobudur, built in the IX century, is a key tourist attraction and pilgrimage site for Mahayana Buddhists.
It was previously targeted in a bombing in 1985, and security was tightened last year after an attack on another Buddhist temple in Jakarta.
The temple has over 500 Buddha statues and is an important cultural and religious site in Indonesia.

The reviewer describes their visit to Candi Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world, located on the island of Java.
They arrived at the temple early in the morning to witness a stunning sunrise, climbing through the dark with a guide and torch in hand.
The temple, built in the 9th century, is a massive structure made of interlocking stone blocks and decorated with bas-relief panels and Buddha statues.
The pilgrimage through the temple represents three levels of Buddhist spirituality, culminating in the central dome surrounded by Buddha statues.
The temple reflects a mix of Hindu and Buddhist influences, with bas-reliefs depicting daily life, the life of Buddha, and other figures.
The temple was abandoned in the 14th century and rediscovered in the 19th century, suffering damage from looting, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.
Despite these challenges, the temple was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and continues to be a place of pilgrimage for Buddhists in Indonesia.
The reviewer recommends visiting the temple early in the morning to avoid the heat and experience the stunning sunrise, feeling blessed and fortunate to have seen and photographed such a remarkable structure.

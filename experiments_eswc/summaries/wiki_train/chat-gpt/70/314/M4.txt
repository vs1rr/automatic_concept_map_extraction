The debate surrounding the so-called "CSI effects" revolves around the influence of popular crime television shows, such as Crime Scene Investigations (CSI), on legal decisions in courts around the world.
Forensic scientists have raised concerns about the unrealistic portrayals of forensic work in these shows, leading to fears that jurors' expectations and trust in forensic science may be skewed by fictional media portrayals.
While some positive effects of CSI exposure, such as increased awareness of forensic evidence, have been noted, the majority of effects are seen as negative, potentially leading to unwarranted acquittals when forensic evidence does not match expectations created by TV shows.


Surveys of lawyers, judges, and forensic scientists have confirmed the existence of CSI effects, with many professionals reporting changes in courtroom practices due to jurors' unreasonable expectations of forensic science.
In Australia, debates have centered on jury responses to DNA profiling evidence, with concerns raised about the impact of CSI effects on jury verdicts.
However, empirical data from studies in the US and Australia have failed to show a significant relationship between CSI exposure and jury verdicts, indicating that frequent viewing of crime shows does not necessarily compromise the fairness of trials.


Jurors' capacity to distinguish between fantasy and reality, as portrayed in CSI shows, has been highlighted in research, with findings suggesting that perceived realism of the show may influence viewers' attitudes towards forensic evidence.
While frequent CSI viewers may express more trust in forensic science, this does not necessarily translate into biased verdicts.
Mock jurors in trial simulations have demonstrated the ability to differentiate between the sophisticated depictions of forensic evidence in CSI shows and the reality of courtroom proceedings, suggesting that jurors are capable of making informed decisions based on the evidence presented in court.


In conclusion, discussions about CSI effects need to be more nuanced, taking into account the different types of effects and the ability of jurors to distinguish between fiction and reality.
Until compelling evidence emerges to show that frequent CSI viewing actually distorts jury verdicts, there is no need to modify court procedures or eliminate juries in cases involving forensic scientific evidence.
It is important for professionals in the criminal justice system to base their practices on evidence rather than assumptions about the influence of media portrayals on jurors.

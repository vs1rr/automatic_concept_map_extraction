The field of art conservation is experiencing a shift towards a more scientific approach, neglecting historical knowledge and technical skill.
Many undergraduate programs in art conservation lack a strong emphasis on art history and studio art, focusing instead on chemistry and materials science.
This trend is concerning, as conservators are expected to make key decisions regarding the treatment of valuable cultural and historical objects with minimal training in art history and studio art.
Graduate programs in art conservation, such as those at the University of Delaware, emphasize the importance of art history in understanding an artist's hand before treatment.
However, even at the graduate level, there is a lack of advanced studio training, with a focus on technical training in lab-based courses.
The training of art conservators relies heavily on independent experience through internships, rather than coursework.
It is essential for conservators to have a solid foundation in art history in order to work professionally in the field.
As the field of art conservation enters a "CSI" phase, it is crucial for conservators, art historians, artists, and the general public to trust their eyes and not rely solely on scientific knowledge when preserving artistic heritage.

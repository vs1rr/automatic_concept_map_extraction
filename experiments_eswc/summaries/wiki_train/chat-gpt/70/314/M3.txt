The CSI effect refers to the exaggerated portrayal of forensic science on TV shows, leading to unrealistic public perceptions.
It influences public perception by shaping views on crime scene investigators, technologies, evidence collection, and scientific outcomes.
This is important because public expectations can impact jury trials, potentially leading to wrongful acquittals.
The effect has caused jurors to expect more forensic evidence than necessary and to have excessive confidence in DNA evidence.
As a result, prosecutors have had to adjust their approach to presenting cases, while defense attorneys have found new ways to create doubt in jurors' minds.
Jury selection now includes questioning potential jurors about their TV viewing habits.
The CSI effect has also educated potential criminals on forensic science.
Overall, the effect has changed the landscape of criminal investigations and legal proceedings, highlighting the need for a more realistic understanding of forensic science.

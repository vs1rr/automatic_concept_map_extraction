The CSI Effect refers to the influence of crime television shows on jurors, leading them to demand more forensic evidence in criminal trials.
This phenomenon has raised the burden of proof for prosecutors and has led to unrealistic expectations for the capabilities of forensic science.
Jurors now expect DNA tests, handwriting analyses, and other procedures seen on TV shows, even when they are not necessarily relevant to the case.
This poses challenges for both the prosecution and defense sides of the legal process.
The increased demand for forensic evidence has also inflated workloads for crime laboratories.
Jurors now expect to see scientific evidence in every criminal case, including DNA, fingerprint, and firearms laboratory evidence.
However, successful prosecution or defense can occur with other important evidence such as expert testimony, crime scene reports, and medical records.
It is important to remember that no single piece of evidence should solely determine the guilt or innocence of an alleged offender.
The overall examination of various pieces of evidence is crucial for jurors to arrive at a fair verdict.
Paul Clements, PhD, discusses these issues in his column "Forensically Speaking" and will be a keynote speaker at the "Forensic Trends in Health Care" conference at Drexel University in Philadelphia.

The idea of nullification, which allows states to reject federal laws deemed unconstitutional, has been circulating among state legislators.
While Thomas Jefferson endorsed nullification in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, James Madison's Virginia Resolution only supports the theory of "interposition," where states express dissatisfaction with federal laws and push for repeal.
Madison explicitly opposed nullification during the Nullification Crisis under Andrew Jackson's presidency.
Alexander Hamilton also criticized nullification, as it would turn the US back into a neo-confederate form of government.
Nullification goes against the purpose of the Constitution and Article VI, which establishes federal law as supreme.
States have other legal means to fight unconstitutional legislation, such as filing lawsuits, and should avoid the chaotic and unconstitutional method of nullification.

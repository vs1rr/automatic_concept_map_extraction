The Alien and Sedition Acts were a series of four bills passed by the Federalist-dominated 5th United States Congress and signed into law by President John Adams in 1798.
These acts included the Naturalization Act, which increased the residency requirement for American citizenship, the Alien Friends Act, which allowed the president to imprison or deport aliens considered dangerous, the Alien Enemies Act, which authorized the president to do the same to male citizens of hostile nations during times of war, and the Sedition Act, which criminalized making false statements critical of the federal government.
The Federalists argued that these acts were necessary for national security during an undeclared naval war with France, while critics viewed them as an attempt to suppress voters who disagreed with the Federalist party and a violation of freedom of speech.


The acts were controversial and ultimately led to the victory of the Democratic-Republicans in the 1800 election, with Thomas Jefferson defeating incumbent President Adams.
The Sedition Act and Alien Friends Act were allowed to expire, but the Alien Enemies Act remains in effect today.
The acts were denounced by Democratic-Republicans and resulted in the highly controversial Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, authored by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.


Prominent prosecutions under the Sedition Act included individuals such as James Thomson Callender, Matthew Lyon, Benjamin Franklin Bache, Anthony Haswell, Luther Baldwin, and David Brown.
These individuals were prosecuted for their criticism of the government, with some facing fines and imprisonment.


The Alien Enemies Acts remained in effect during World War I and were used by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during World War II to imprison and deport Japanese, German, and Italian aliens.
The internment of Japanese Americans was a result of Executive Order 9066, which was issued under the authority of the revised Alien Enemies Act.
President Harry S. Truman also used the Alien Enemies Act to continue to detain alien enemies after the end of hostilities.


In the 20th and 21st centuries, the Alien Enemies Acts have continued to be cited in various contexts.
For example, President Donald Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States was compared to Roosevelt's use of the Alien Enemies Act during World War II.
Critics have argued that such proposals violate founding principles and are unconstitutional.


Overall, the Alien and Sedition Acts were controversial and have had lasting implications on issues of national security, freedom of speech, and the treatment of immigrants and alien enemies in the United States.

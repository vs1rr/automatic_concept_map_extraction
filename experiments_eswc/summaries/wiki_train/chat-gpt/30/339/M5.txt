In this text, James Madison discusses the Virginia Resolutions passed in 1798 concerning the Alien and Sedition Laws.
The resolutions express a commitment to defending the Constitution of the United States and the state of Virginia against aggression, both foreign and domestic.
They also emphasize the importance of maintaining the union of states and opposing any actions that threaten the principles on which the union is based.
The resolutions assert that the federal government's powers are limited by the Constitution and that the states have the right to interpose if the government exceeds its authority.
Madison argues that the states, as parties to the Constitution, have the ultimate authority to judge whether the government has violated the compact.
He addresses objections that the judiciary should be the sole interpreter of the Constitution, stating that in cases of dangerous usurpation, the states must have the final say.
Madison concludes by emphasizing the importance of returning to fundamental principles to safeguard against the degeneracy of republics and ensure the sovereignty of the people over their government.

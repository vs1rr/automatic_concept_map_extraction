In this text, Publius Huldah discusses the concept of nullification and rebukes those who deny its legitimacy.
She argues that nullification is a natural right of self-defense, rooted in the principles of the Declaration of Independence.
Huldah explains that nullification is a reserved power of the States and the People, and is necessary when the federal government acts outside the Constitution.
She refutes false assertions made by nullification deniers, such as the idea that States cannot nullify unconstitutional acts because the Constitution does not explicitly grant them that power.
Huldah also addresses the misconception that nullification is impossible, emphasizing the conditions that must be present for it to be proper and possible.
She provides historical examples of nullification, such as the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, and explains how nullification is a natural right that pre-dates the Constitution.
Huldah concludes by urging readers to educate themselves on the Founding Principles and to reject the lies perpetuated by those who oppose nullification.

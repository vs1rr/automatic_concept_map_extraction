outside the forms and procedures of the Constitution, such an act would have been an exercise of the ultimate authority of the people as the collective sovereign.

However, because South Carolina acted alone, its nullification was not an exercise of the people’s ultimate authority but rather an act of revolution.

Madison’s theory of interposition, as exemplified by the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, provided a means for the people to monitor the constitutional operation of government.

This theory allowed for the people to express their opinions, petition their government, and ultimately use their ultimate authority as the collective sovereign to address constitutional issues.

In contrast, the state veto proposed by Calhoun and the nullification attempted by South Carolina were based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the federal union and the sovereignty of the people in the states.

By clarifying the distinction between interposition and nullification, Madison’s theory of interposition offers a valuable corrective to the mischaracterization of his views and provides insight into the proper exercise of sovereign constitutional powers.

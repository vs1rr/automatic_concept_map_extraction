The East India Company played a crucial role in the formation of the British Empire by establishing trading posts in India and expanding its influence through military alliances and commercial access.
The company's trade routes brought significant cultural and economic changes to Britain, with tea from China becoming a key contribution.
However, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the company's army faced resistance from Indian peasants, leading to immense human suffering and ultimately the dissolution of the company in 1858.
Following this, the administration of India became the responsibility of the British Crown.

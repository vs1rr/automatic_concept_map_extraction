The British Empire was the largest empire in history, spanning a quarter of the world and making the United Kingdom the most powerful country for over a century.
It began in the 17th century and included dominions, colonies, protectorates, and mandates ruled by the UK.
By the 1920s, it covered a quarter of the Earth's land surface and had 458 million people.
The empire was known as 'the empire on which the sun never sets' due to its vast reach.
English became the world's most common international language due to British influence.
The empire faced challenges, including the loss of the American colonies in the 18th century and setbacks during the world wars.
After World War II, many colonies gained independence, leading to the dissolution of the empire.
India gained independence in 1947, followed by African countries in the 1960s.
The Commonwealth was formed, with many former colonies choosing to remain part of it.
Tensions arose as countries gained independence, leading to divisions such as the split of India into India and Pakistan.
Despite its decline, the British Empire's influence is still seen in many parts of the world today.

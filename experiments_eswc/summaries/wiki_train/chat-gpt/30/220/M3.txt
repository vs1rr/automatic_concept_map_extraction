A protectorate is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state.
In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly depending on the nature of their relationship.
Protectorates are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of.
A state that remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates.
Protectorates can be established for various reasons, including moral obligations, countering rival powers, or maintaining control of strategic areas.
Protectorates often have direct foreign relations only with the protecting power and rely on the protector for defense.
They do not have formal power to control the internal affairs of the protectorate.
Protectorates differ from League of Nations Mandates and United Nations Trust Territories, which are supervised by the international community.
Examples of protectorates include Ruanda-Urundi, British protectorates in Africa, and various protectorates in Asia, Oceania, and the Americas.
The concept of protectorates has been used by various countries throughout history, including the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, and Spain.
The United Nations has also been involved in establishing protectorates in regions such as West Papua, Cambodia, Eastern Croatia, East Timor, and Kosovo.
Protectorates can also be joint, such as the Adriatic Republic of Ragusa and the United States of the Ionian Islands.

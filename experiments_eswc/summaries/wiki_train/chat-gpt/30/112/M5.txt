The Book of Kells, also known as the Book of Columba, is a famous illuminated manuscript created by Celtic monks around AD 800 in the style of Insular art.
It is named after the Abbey of Kells in Ireland, where it was kept for much of the medieval period.
The exact date and place of production of the manuscript have been debated, with theories suggesting it was created at Iona and finished at Kells.
The book contains the four gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script.
It consists of 340 folios, with some folios believed to be lost.
The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its age, with intricate artwork and decorations throughout.
The text is accompanied by full pages of artwork, with a broad palette of colors used.
The book does not contain gold or silver leaf, and the pigments used for the illustrations were imported from all over Europe.
The Book of Kells is known for its lavish illumination program, with ten full-page illuminations and 13 full pages of decorated text.
The manuscript also contains smaller decorations and decorated initials scattered throughout the text.
The surviving folios of the manuscript start with a fragment of a glossary of Hebrew names and a miniature of the four evangelist symbols.
The four evangelist symbols are a recurring theme throughout the book, emphasizing the unity of the message of the four Gospels.
Despite some damage to the delicate artwork, the Book of Kells remains a remarkable example of medieval artistry and craftsmanship.

The Book of Kells is a famous illuminated manuscript written by monks in medieval Ireland over 1,200 years ago.
It is named after the village of Kells where it was kept for centuries.
The book took 75 years to complete and contains the four gospels in Latin.
The pages are richly illuminated with colorful birds, animals, and figures.
The Book of Kells was transferred to Trinity College Library in Dublin in 1661 and exact facsimile replicas were later published.
The Hackley Public Library in North America has a replica on display, funded by donations.
The pages are turned weekly and a video and commentary volume are available for further information.

Bruce Castle in Tottenham is the second most famous building in the area after White Hart Lane Stadium.
Originally built in 1254 by the Bruce family, the manor house has a rich history, including hosting Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.
The house was later renamed by Lord Coleraine and served as a school known for its progressive teaching methods.
Today, Bruce Castle is a museum with exhibitions on Haringey's history and Rowland Hill.
The house has undergone several renovations over the centuries to align with changing architectural styles.
A tower on the property was built to house falcons, and the purpose of a curious tower on the left side has been a subject of speculation.
The house was extensively remodeled in the 18th century to reflect Georgian tastes.
The view from the observation platform is said to be astonishing.
A drawing from 1793 shows the house looking similar to its current state.
A drawing from 1815 gives a Gothic view of the house, adding to its eerie charm.
Despite its changes over the years, Bruce Castle remains a significant historical landmark in Tottenham.

Bruce Castle Park in Haringey is located on the site of one of the four manors of Tottenham, with the only remaining mansion in the area.
The park is named after its connection to the Scottish royal family of de Brus.
The present house was likely built in the 1620s, and in 1827 it became a pioneering school until 1891 when both the house and park were purchased by Tottenham UDC.
The park was given a new layout and opened in August 1892, becoming Tottenham's first public park.
The park's layout has remained largely unchanged since then, with many trees dating back to the 19th century.
Bruce Castle became a museum in 1906 and continues to house the local history collection.
The park offers various facilities such as football, tennis, bowls, basketball, a playground, and a paddling pool.
Events are also held in the park, including the Tottenham Community Festival and Bruce Castle Carnival.
The park is open to the public and can be accessed via public transport.
The park has won a Green Flag Award for consecutive years since 2003.

Bruce Castle, also known as Lordship House, is a manor house in Tottenham, London with a rich history and even a resident ghost.
Despite its name, there is no direct connection to the Bruce family.
The Tudor Tower, a dovecote, is the earliest existing structure on the grounds.
The house has undergone numerous remodels over the years, with the core believed to have been built during Henry VIII's reign.
The house changed hands frequently, with Hugh Hare renaming it Bruce Castle to elevate his social status.
Hare's connections at court led to his involvement in the Civil War, during which his properties were seized but later returned after the Restoration.
The house later became a school under Sir Rowland Hill, who introduced the world's first postage stamp.
The school was progressive in its curriculum and teaching methods.
After closing, the house became a museum in 1906.
Despite its historical significance, the house's true origins and connections remain a mystery, with rumors of ghosts and tragic love stories adding to its allure.

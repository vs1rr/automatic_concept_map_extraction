The CSI Effect refers to the belief that forensic science television dramas, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, influence jurors to expect more forensic evidence in criminal cases.
While police and prosecutors acknowledge the unrealistic portrayal of forensic science on TV, they are concerned that it shapes public expectations of crime solving.
However, empirical research has not substantiated the CSI Effect, with some suggesting that watching CSI may actually increase jurors' tendency to convict.
Despite this, there have been instances where jurors have specifically requested forensic evidence, prompting prosecutors to explain its absence in a case.
Research conducted in Ann Arbor, Michigan, found that while CSI viewers had higher expectations for scientific evidence, it did not significantly impact their willingness to convict.
This suggests that differences in expectations about evidence do not necessarily translate into differences in conviction rates.
The rise in popularity of forensic science TV shows has also led to an increase in universities offering forensic science degrees and students pursuing those degrees.

The debate surrounding the "CSI effect" revolves around whether frequent viewing of crime television shows like Crime Scene Investigations (CSI) influences legal decisions.
Concerns have been raised about jurors' expectations of forensic science and police procedures being shaped by fictional portrayals, potentially impacting the rights of defendants and crime victims.
While some positive effects of CSI exposure include increased awareness of forensic evidence, the majority are negative, such as unwarranted defendant acquittals due to unrealistic expectations set by media portrayals.
However, despite the widespread discussion, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that viewing crime shows like CSI has a negative impact on jury verdicts.


Recent debates in Australia have focused on jury responses to DNA profiling evidence, with concerns about excessive trust and weight being placed on such evidence due to CSI effects.
Surveys have shown that lawyers, judges, and forensic scientists acknowledge the existence of CSI effects, with many reporting changes in courtroom practices as a result.
Forensic scientists believe that forensic television programs negatively affect public perceptions of their work, leading to increased demands for DNA sample testing in court cases.


Among the potential CSI effects identified, the focus has been on increased juror expectations of forensic evidence and misplaced trust in such evidence, potentially weakening the defense case.
Studies have shown that frequent CSI viewers have higher expectations of forensic evidence in trials and place more trust in DNA evidence.
However, despite these findings, there is no significant relationship between CSI exposure and jury verdicts, indicating that viewers' beliefs do not impact their decisions in the courtroom.


Jurors have shown the ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality when it comes to forensic science, with perceived realism of CSI shows being a predictor of their beliefs.
In trial simulations, jurors were not unduly persuaded by sophisticated technological depictions of forensic evidence, indicating their ability to discern between simulations and reality.
Overall, discussions about CSI effects need more qualification, and until evidence emerges that jurors' verdicts are distorted by frequent CSI viewing, there is no need to modify court procedures or dispense with juries in cases involving forensic evidence.

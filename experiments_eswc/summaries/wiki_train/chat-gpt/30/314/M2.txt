The "CSI effect" is a concern as it may impact jurors' ability to reach a verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.
Shows like "CSI" exaggerate forensic science, leading people to believe it is how investigations really work.
This has increased demand for forensic evidence and raised expectations for forensic scientists and detectives.
Viewers may expect clear-cut evidence in every case, despite the exaggerated portrayal on TV.
These shows constantly introduce new analysis methods to stay interesting, potentially teaching criminals how to evade detection.
The question remains whether producers should tone down the exaggeration in these shows to prevent criminals from using them as a guide.

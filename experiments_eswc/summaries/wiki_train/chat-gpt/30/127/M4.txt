During the Middle Ages, castles were built as fortified homes for kings and nobility to defend themselves and rule over their land.
Originally made of wood, castles were later built with stone for added strength.
Common features of castles included moats, keeps, curtain walls, arrow slits, gatehouses, and battlements.
Famous castles such as Windsor Castle, Tower of London, and Chateau Gaillard were built by rulers like William the Conqueror and Richard the Lionheart.
Castles were also used for various purposes such as prisons, treasuries, and royal residences.
Siege engines like battering rams and catapults were used to attack castles, and sieges were common tactics to starve out castle dwellers.
Castles were often built on springs for a water source during a siege, and cats and dogs were kept to control rats.
Overall, castles played a significant role in medieval Europe as symbols of power and defense.

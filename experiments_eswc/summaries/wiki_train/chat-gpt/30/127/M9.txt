Castles have been built in various forms over the centuries, serving as private fortified residences for monarchs and noblemen.
The word "castle" is derived from the Latin word "castellum" and has been used to describe structures such as Iron Age fortifications.
Castles were initially built from earth and timber but later replaced with stone.
They served military, administrative, and domestic purposes, with Norman invaders establishing many castles in England to secure their conquests.
As time passed, the aesthetics of castle design became more important, reflecting the prestige and power of their occupants.
However, with the advancement of powerful cannons, castles lost their military significance and were eventually replaced by country houses.
Castles originated in Europe in the 9th and 10th centuries, controlling the surrounding areas and serving as both defensive and offensive structures.
They evolved in response to changing siege technology and also functioned as symbols of power and centers of administration.
In some countries, permission from the king was required to build a castle, while in others, such as Switzerland, there was no state control over castle construction.
Changes in castle defense, such as polygonal designs and concentric defense, were influenced by Crusade technology and earlier defenses like Roman forts.
Elements of castle architecture, both military and decorative, were used to impress visitors and symbolize power.
The introduction of gunpowder in the 14th century eventually led to the decline of true castles, as they became vulnerable to artillery fire.
From the 18th century onwards, there was a revival of interest in castles, leading to the construction of mock castles for aesthetic purposes.
Ultimately, castles transitioned from military strongholds to romanticized architectural symbols with no practical military function.

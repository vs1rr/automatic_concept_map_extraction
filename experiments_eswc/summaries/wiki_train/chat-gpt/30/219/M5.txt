The Manhattan Project was a top-secret U.S. government initiative during World War II to develop the atomic bomb before Germany or Japan.
It was sparked by a warning from Albert Einstein about the potential for nuclear weapons.
The project was named after the Manhattan Engineering District and primarily carried out in three secret cities: Hanford, Oak Ridge, and Los Alamos.
The first atomic bombs, "Gadget," "Little Boy," and "Fat Man," were designed and built at Los Alamos and tested at Trinity in New Mexico.
The bombs were ultimately dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, leading to Japan's unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945.
The project remained classified for many years, and even Vice President Harry S. Truman was not aware of its existence until after President Roosevelt's death.
The Manhattan Project marked the beginning of the nuclear age and introduced the most destructive weapon known to mankind.
The project's legacy includes advancements in nuclear development and control, as well as ethical debates surrounding the use of atomic weapons.
The quotes from J. Robert Oppenheimer and various books related to the Manhattan Project reflect the gravity and impact of this historic endeavor.

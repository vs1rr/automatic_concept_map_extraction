In the early stages of World War II, the British Mission was established to explore the potential military applications of uranium fission.
Initially, there was skepticism within official British circles about the feasibility of a controlled fission chain reaction.
However, a breakthrough came in March 1940 with a memorandum by Frisch and Peierls, predicting the possibility of a uranium bomb.
This led to the formation of the MAUD Committee, which commissioned research at various universities and industrial facilities in the UK.


By the end of 1940, it was established that a bomb was feasible, and methods for producing uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were identified.
Cooperation between the UK and the US was deemed mutually advantageous, and the two countries began exchanging information on their respective nuclear research programs.
The British recognized that they would need to rely on the US for the expensive development work due to their limited resources.


In 1941, the US established an all-out development program for nuclear weapons, and President Roosevelt endorsed complete information exchange with Britain.
However, the British were initially ambivalent about full integration into the American project.
By 1943, after some misunderstandings were resolved, the two countries signed the Quebec Agreement, outlining terms for joint collaboration on the bomb project.


British scientists, including Chadwick, Peierls, and Oliphant, began working in the US, contributing to various aspects of the Manhattan Project.
The British presence had a positive impact on the morale of the Project and provided valuable second opinions from respected scientists.
Despite General Groves' acknowledgment of the British contribution, he believed the US could have proceeded without them.


After the war, the British were able to undertake an independent nuclear weapons program, thanks in part to the knowledge gained through collaboration with the US during the Manhattan Project.
The 1958 U.S.-U.K. Agreement for Mutual Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy further solidified the partnership between the two countries in the field of nuclear defense.


The British Mission's involvement in the Manhattan Project had a lasting impact on the development of nuclear weapons technology and the ongoing cooperation between the UK and the US in the field of atomic energy for defense purposes.
The collaboration between the two countries, despite its challenges and differences, has been viewed as beneficial for their joint defense interests.

The Manhattan Project was a collaborative effort between the US, UK, and Canada to build the atomic bomb, with the US providing most of the resources.
In late 1942, James B. Conant argued that the US should exclude the British from the production phase of the project, citing concerns about secrecy and the British not contributing enough.
However, the British eventually gained equal participation through the Quebec Agreement, despite initial resistance from Conant and Vannevar Bush.
The British delegation at Los Alamos made significant contributions, but the difficulty of controlling secrecy proved to be a valid concern, as evidenced by the presence of atomic spies like Klaus Fuchs.
Ultimately, the British were involved in the project, but the issue of secrecy remained a challenge.

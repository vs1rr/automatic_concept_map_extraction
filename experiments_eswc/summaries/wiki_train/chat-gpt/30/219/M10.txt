75 years ago, University of Birmingham physicists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch published a memorandum that set the stage for the invention of the nuclear bomb.
The pair, both refugees from the Nazis, outlined how a super bomb could be created, a concept previously only seen in science fiction.
With the support of Birmingham professor Mark Oliphant, who had transformed the physics department, Peierls and Frisch had access to the necessary resources to conduct their research.
Their calculations showed that only five kilos of pure U235 would be needed to create a chain reaction with explosive results.
This information was quickly sent to the government, leading to the funding of research to develop a British version of the bomb.
Ultimately, the Manhattan Project was born, with British assistance, and the bomb was developed in time to end the war.
The play "Oppenheimer" by Tom Moreton-Smith delves into the personal cost of making history during the Manhattan Project.
The pivotal role of the University of Birmingham in the invention of nuclear weapons highlights the groundbreaking work of Peierls and Frisch, who were instrumental in changing the course of history with their calculations and research.

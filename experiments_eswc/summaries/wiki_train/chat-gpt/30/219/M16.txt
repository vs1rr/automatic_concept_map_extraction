The Manhattan Project was a top-secret American effort during World War II to build the first atomic bomb.
It was initiated after Albert Einstein warned President Franklin Roosevelt about the possibility of the Nazis creating their own atomic bombs.
The project involved key figures such as Robert Oppenheimer, General Leslie R. Groves, and Vannevar Bush, who worked with scientists and mathematicians to develop the bomb.
The project also received support from Canada and Britain, with Canada providing uranium for the bomb.
The first atomic bomb was tested in 1945 and later dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of WWII.
The Manhattan Project marked the beginning of the nuclear age and had a significant impact on the future development of atomic weapons.
The project also had its share of controversies, such as the involvement of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs.
Overall, the Manhattan Project was a pivotal moment in history that changed the course of warfare and international relations.

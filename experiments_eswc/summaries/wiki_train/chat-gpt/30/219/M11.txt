Britain's journey towards developing nuclear weapons began with the MAUD Committee in 1940, which laid the groundwork for fission bomb design and uranium enrichment.
Cooperation with the U.S. and Canada during WWII continued through the Quebec Agreement, with British scientists contributing to the Manhattan Project.
After the war, Prime Minister Clement Attlee established a secret Cabinet committee on atomic energy to set nuclear policy.
Physicist William G. Penney, a key member of the British Mission at Los Alamos during the war, played a crucial role in the development of Britain's atomic weapons program.
Penney's expertise in hydrodynamic waves and his involvement in Operation Crossroads led to his appointment as the leader of Britain's nuclear weapon program in 1947.
The program, code named BHER, was based at Woolwich Arsenal and involved multiple research sites.
By 1950, a single site at Aldermaston was selected for atomic weapons development, with plutonium production taking place at Windscale and Capenhurst.
In 1952, Britain conducted its first nuclear test, code named Hurricane, on the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Australia.
The test, involving a plutonium implosion bomb, was successful and marked Britain's entry into the nuclear weapons club.

Otto Robert Frisch was an Austrian-British physicist born in Vienna in 1904.
He studied at the University of Vienna and worked in various laboratories in Germany before moving to London in 1933 due to the rise of Adolf Hitler.
In 1938, he, along with his aunt Lise Meitner, explained the process of nuclear fission after the discovery of uranium splitting into barium.
Frisch and Rudolf Peierls produced the Frisch-Peierls memorandum in 1939, outlining the process for creating an atomic explosion using separated Uranium-235.
This memorandum formed the basis for the British Tube Alloys project and the Manhattan Project.
Frisch worked on determining the critical mass of enriched uranium needed for the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
He later returned to England to work at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell and taught at Cambridge.
In retirement, he designed a device called SWEEPNIK and helped found a company, Laser-Scan Limited.
Frisch passed away in 1979, leaving behind a son who also became a physicist.
His works include "Atomic Physics Today" and "What Little I Remember."

In September 1854, Owen R. Rozier complained that his slave, Stephen Spencer Hill, had escaped and stolen from him in the Gold Rush.
Hill's white neighbors, known as the Gold Spring Boys, helped him escape as they did not believe he was Rozier's property.
Despite California being a free state, Hill did not have the paperwork to prove he was free, and a judge ruled in Rozier's favor.
Slavery was not popular in the mines, but there were no laws against it in the early days of the Gold Rush.
California eventually declared itself a free state in 1849, tipping the balance of free and slave states in the nation.
The Compromise of 1850 allowed California to enter the Union under its own terms, but civil rights were not extended to African Americans or Native Americans in the state.
California also passed its own version of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1852, allowing white slave owners to reclaim escaped black slaves.
The Monterey delegates who made California a free state did so based on the mining economy, not out of anti-racism.

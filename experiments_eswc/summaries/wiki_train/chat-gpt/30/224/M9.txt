The Gold Rush in California from 1848 to 1865 brought about significant changes to the state.
The discovery of gold attracted over 300,000 gold seekers from around the world, creating a multicultural and chaotic society.
The native population suffered greatly during this time, with their numbers plummeting due to violence and exploitation by American miners.
The Californios, elite Spanish-speaking residents, also faced challenges as they lost power, land, and privilege to American settlers.
The discrimination extended to other groups as well, such as Chinese and African Americans, who faced prejudice and legal barriers.
Despite these challenges, there were instances of cross-cultural cooperation and communication in the diverse society of Gold Rush California.
The state's diversity would continue to shape its identity in the years to come.

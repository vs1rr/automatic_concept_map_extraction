The California Gold Rush began in 1848 when gold was discovered at Sutter's Lumber Mill in Coloma, California, attracting 300,000 prospectors known as "forty-niners" seeking instant wealth.
In 1852 alone, $80 million worth of gold was extracted.
The discovery occurred before California was officially ceded to the United States in 1848.
The map of the Gold Rush shows various locations where gold was found, including Sutter's Mill, Mormon Island, Bidwell's Bar, Weber's Creek, and Rich Bar.
The Gold Rush was a significant event during James Polk

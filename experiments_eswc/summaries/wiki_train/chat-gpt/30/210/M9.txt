Ancient Egypt was a dominant civilization in the Mediterranean world for almost 30 centuries, from around 3100 B.C. to 332 B.C. Egyptology, the study of ancient Egypt, has been fueled by the many monuments, objects, and artifacts covered in hieroglyphs that have been recovered from archaeological sites.
The culture of ancient Egypt was known for its art, architecture, and religious traditions.


The Predynastic Period, from around 5000 to 3100 B.C., saw the gradual development of Egyptian civilization.
Neolithic communities in northeastern Africa transitioned from hunting to agriculture, laying the groundwork for advancements in arts, crafts, technology, politics, and religion.
Around 3400 B.C., two separate kingdoms were established in Egypt, with King Menes eventually unifying the country in the first dynasty.


The Archaic Period (3100-2686 B.C.) saw the establishment of the capital at White Walls (later known as Memphis) and the development of the ideology of kingship.
The king was seen as a godlike being, closely associated with the powerful god Horus.
Agriculture, particularly wheat and barley farming, formed the economic base of the Egyptian state.


The Old Kingdom (2686-2181 B.C.) was known as the Age of the Pyramid Builders.
King Djoser commissioned the world's first major stone building, the Step-Pyramid at Saqqara, designed by architect Imhotep.
The Great Pyramid at Giza, built for Khufu, was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world.
The Old Kingdom saw a golden age of peace, prosperity, and pyramid-building, but eventually declined due to economic challenges and a weakening central government.


The First Intermediate Period (2181-2055 B.C.) followed the collapse of the Old Kingdom, marked by civil war, famine, and disease.
Egypt was divided into different kingdoms until Theban prince Mentuhotep reunited the country in the 11th dynasty, beginning the Middle Kingdom (2055-1786 B.C.).
The Middle Kingdom saw a resurgence of Egyptian power, colonization of Nubia, and aggressive foreign policy.


The Second Intermediate Period (1786-1567 B.C.) was a time of division and foreign rule, with the Hyksos taking control of Egypt.
The New Kingdom (1567-1085 B.C.) began with the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I. The New Kingdom saw the establishment of a great empire, military campaigns, and the rule of powerful kings and queens like Hatshepsut and Ramses II.


The Third Intermediate Period (1085-664 B.C.) saw changes in Egyptian politics, society, and culture, with the rise of local officials and foreign rulers.
The Saite dynasty briefly reunited Egypt before falling to the Persians in 525 B.C. Egypt regained independence briefly before falling to the Persians again in 343 B.C. and ultimately being conquered by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C.

After Alexander's death, Egypt was ruled by a line of Macedonian kings, including Cleopatra VII, until surrendering to the Romans in 31 B.C.
Christianity became the official religion of Rome and its provinces, including Egypt.
The Arabs conquered Egypt in the seventh century A.D., introducing Islam and marking the end of ancient Egyptian culture.

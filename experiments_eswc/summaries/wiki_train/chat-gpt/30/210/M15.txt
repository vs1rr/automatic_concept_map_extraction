The Roman province of Egypt, known as Aegyptus, was established in 30 BC under the reign of Augustus after defeating Mark Anthony and Cleopatra.
The capital of Egypt was Alexandria, and the province was named after an ancient Greek ruler named Aegyptus.
The governor of Egypt was appointed by Augustus and had control over the administration, justice, and military security.
The Romans derived significant revenue from Egypt through a complex tax system, with taxes levied on land and collected in cash.
The social hierarchy introduced by the Romans placed Romans and Greeks at the top, followed by metropolites and villagers.
Egypt was an essential source of food for the Romans, and trading activity flourished in the 1st and 2nd centuries.
Christianity spread throughout Egypt, with Alexandria becoming a major center.
After the partition of the Roman Empire, Egypt became part of the Byzantine Empire, with Greek remaining the popular language.
Alexandria continued to be a religious and economic center, as well as a vital source of food supply for the Romans.

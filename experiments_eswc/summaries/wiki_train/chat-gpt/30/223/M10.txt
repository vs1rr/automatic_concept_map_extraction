Justinian I, born around 482 CE in Tauresium, Illyria, was the nephew of Emperor Justin I. He reigned from 527 to 565 CE and is considered one of the most important late Roman and Byzantine emperors.
Justinian initiated military campaigns to retake Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Goths.
He also ordered the rebuilding of the Hagia Sophia church and completed the Codex Iustinianus, which brought together all Roman laws issued from Emperor Hadrian to the present.
Justinian's early life is not well-documented, but he was brought to Constantinople by his uncle for education and eventually became Consul and commander of the Eastern army.
In 525 CE, he married Theodora, a woman from a poor background.
Justinian's military career began in the east with the Iberian War against the Sassanian Empire.
He successfully reconquered Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Goths, with the help of General Belisarius.
However, the Gothic War continued with the rise of Totila, who briefly reconquered Italy before being defeated by Narses in 553 CE.
Justinian's reign was marked by civil discontent, including the Nika riots in 532 CE and Samaritan revolts in 529 CE and 559 CE.
He commissioned the Codex Iustinianus, a compilation of Roman laws, and his life was recorded by Procopius in works that both praised and criticized his reign.
Justinian's achievements in art, architecture, legal reform, and conquest have earned him a place as one of the greatest emperors in late Roman and Byzantine history.
His Christian faith influenced his rule and marked a transition of emperors as leaders of faith and patronage.

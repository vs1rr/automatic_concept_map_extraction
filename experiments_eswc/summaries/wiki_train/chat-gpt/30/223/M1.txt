The Byzantine Empire, originating in 330 A.D. when Roman Emperor Constantine I established a new capital in Byzantium, survived for 1,000 years after the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476.
The empire, known for its rich tradition of art, literature, and learning, served as a military buffer between Europe and Asia.
The eastern half of the Roman Empire, also known as Byzantium, was able to survive due to its geographic location, strong administrative center, and internal political stability.
The empire was ruled by Roman law and political institutions, with Latin as the official language, but Greek was widely spoken and taught.
The Byzantine Empire reached its peak under Emperor Justinian I, who expanded the empire's territory and reformed Roman law.
However, financial struggles and attacks from various invaders, including Islamic forces, led to the empire's decline.
The Byzantine Empire faced internal conflicts, such as the Iconoclasm movement, and external threats, including the Crusades.
The empire eventually fell in 1453 when the Ottoman army stormed Constantinople, marking the end of an era.
Despite its fall, Byzantine culture and civilization continued to influence countries practicing its Orthodox religion, such as Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece.
The legacy of the Byzantine Empire lived on through its impact on the Western intellectual tradition and the preservation of Greek and Christian writings.

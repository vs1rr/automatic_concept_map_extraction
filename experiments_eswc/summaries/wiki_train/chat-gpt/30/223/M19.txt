On May 29th, 1453, Constantinople fell to Ottoman forces after a 40-day siege, marking a significant moment in warfare history.
The fall of the city, considered the queen of cities by Greeks, showed that gunpowder could break down strong walls, ending the era of immobile soldiers defending stone fortresses.
The Byzantine defenders had noticed ominous signs leading up to the fall, including a lunar eclipse and a thunderstorm.
The final assault began with a violent attack on Saint Sophia, the greatest church of eastern Christendom.
Sultan Mehmet, the conqueror, spared some churches and preserved the Greek Orthodox patriarchate, allowing the doctrinal integrity of eastern Christendom to remain intact.
The fall of Constantinople led to the movement of political capital of eastern Orthodoxy to Russia and the flight of Greek scholars to Italy, contributing to the Renaissance.
The fall also marked the beginning of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires' contest in southeastern Europe.
The Turks held various territories until the early 20th century, leaving Muslim pockets in Europe.
The enmities between Turkey and Greece have persisted, with conflicts in Cyprus and ongoing tensions affecting Turkey's potential EU membership.
The fall of Constantinople in 1453 continues to have lasting effects on European history and geopolitics.

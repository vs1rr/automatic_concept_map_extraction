The Battle of Manzikert in 1071 between the Byzantine Empire and Seljuk Turkish forces led by Alp Arslan resulted in the defeat of the Byzantine Empire and the capture of Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes.
The Seljuk Turks had been causing trouble in Armenia and Asia Minor, leading Romanus to lead expeditions against them in 1068 and 1070.
In 1071, Romanus led a large army towards Manzikert, but his forces were unprepared and disorganized.
The Seljuks, led by Arslan, were able to outmaneuver and defeat the Byzantine forces.
Romanus was captured and eventually deposed, blinded, and killed.
Despite relatively low casualties, the defeat at Manzikert was seen as a disaster for the Byzantine Empire, leading to the loss of Anatolia to the Seljuks and the beginning of the empire's decline.
The battle also contributed to the destabilization of the empire and is considered a root cause of the later Crusades.
Historians view Manzikert as a turning point in Byzantine history, marking the beginning of the empire's decline.

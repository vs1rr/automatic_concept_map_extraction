Constantine the Great played a significant role in the fall of the Roman Empire by dividing it in two and making Christianity the dominant religion.
The Visigoths, led by Alaric, breached the walls of Rome in 410 C.E., looting and pillaging the city for three days.
Constantine's decision to end persecution and declare toleration for Christianity in 313 C.E. further weakened the empire, as the new religion spread rapidly.
The split of the empire into western and eastern halves, with Constantinople as the new capital, also contributed to its decline.
The western half faced economic issues, trade deficits, inflation, and attacks from Germanic tribes, while political corruption and a mercenary army further weakened Rome.
The fall of the western half of the Roman Empire allowed various Germanic tribes to settle in different regions, ultimately leading to the end of the order that Rome had brought to western Europe for a millennium.
The eastern half, known as the Byzantine Empire, continued to thrive for hundreds of years after the fall of the west.
The fall of Rome was a result of a combination of factors, including economic decline, political instability, military issues, and the influx of Germanic tribes.

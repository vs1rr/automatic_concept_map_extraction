In 1453, the heavily fortified city of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire, fell to Sultan Mehmed II and his Ottoman Turks after a fifty-day siege.
The Turks used various war tactics, including cannons, warships, and infantry, to breach the city's defenses.
The first attack was led by the Bashi-bazouks, followed by the Anatolian Turks and then the Janissaries.
The Turks eventually overwhelmed the city, with the Janissaries achieving victory in hand-to-hand combat.
The Turks also took control of the sea, using ships to aid in the siege.
After the city fell, Mehmed renamed it Istanbul and implemented new rules for the conquered, including forming Greek communities and restricting the rights of Christians.
The fall of Constantinople marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in the city's history under Ottoman rule.

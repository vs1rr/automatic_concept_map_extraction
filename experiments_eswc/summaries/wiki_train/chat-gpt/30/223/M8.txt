Constantine the Great, a Roman Emperor from 272 to 337 AD, rebuilt the city of Byzantium and renamed it Nova Roma, providing it with a Senate and civic offices similar to Rome.
He became ruler of the Western Roman Empire after defeating Maxentius in 312 and is remembered for being the first Roman Emperor to embrace Christianity, issuing the Edict of Milan in 313 and presiding over the Council of Nicaea in 325.
The Byzantine Empire, with its capital Constantinople, was strategically located for trade between Europe and Asia.
Emperor Justinian, ruling from 527 to 565, sought to reunite the old Roman Empire and created a legal system called Justinian's Code.
After his death, the empire began to decline due to invasions and lost territories.
In 1453, the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople, ending the 1,000-year Roman Empire.
The Byzantine Empire, influenced by Roman, Greek, and outside cultures, developed its own society.
Byzantine emperors held both political and religious power, unlike in the west where the church was separate.
Christianity was central to Byzantine life, reflected in their religious art and architecture, such as the Hagia Sophia.
Despite differences in practices, eastern and western Christianity worked together until the Eastern Orthodox Church split from the rest of the church in the 1000s, leading to a complete division between eastern and western Europe.

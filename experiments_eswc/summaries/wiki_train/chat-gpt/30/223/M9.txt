In terms of science and medicine, Byzantine advancements were limited in mathematics and geometry, but their medicine was more advanced than that of the medieval West, based on classical and Hellenistic writings.
The growth of the Christian Church saw the legalization of Christianity by Constantine, with Theodosius making it the state religion in 380.
The Arian Heresy challenged the church, leading to the Council of Nicaea and the Nicene Creed becoming Christian orthodoxy.
The bishops of Rome began to assert their supremacy over other Christian communities.


Christian monasticism developed with St. Anthony and St. Basil, with Western and Eastern monasticism differing in their practices.
The early Christians were hostile to pagan culture, and Saint Augustine had a significant impact on early Christianity with his writings.

The idea of the barbarian was invented by the Greeks and Romans, with Germanic migrations and the establishment of short-lived kingdoms between 450 and 565.

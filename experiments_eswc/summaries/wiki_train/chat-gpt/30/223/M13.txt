The Byzantine-Sassanid War (602-628) was the final and most significant conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires.
The war began in 602 when Khosrau II invaded Byzantine territory in response to the execution of his ally, Emperor Maurice, by Phocas.
The early years of the war saw several successes for the Sassanids, including the conquest of Syria and Jerusalem.
In 610, Heraclius the Younger overthrew Phocas and became the new Byzantine emperor, attempting to sue for peace with Khosrau.
However, Khosrau refused, determined to expand his empire.
The war continued with Heraclius leading a successful campaign against the Sassanids, culminating in a decisive victory at the Battle of Nineveh in 627.
Khosrau was overthrown, and peace was eventually established between the two empires.
Despite Heraclius' triumph, the war had taken a toll on both empires, with no clear winner emerging.

The period of warfare in the Balkans from 500AD to 1000AD was characterized by the dominance of the Byzantine Empire, which faced invasions from new barbarian tribes such as the Bulgars, Slavs, and Avars.
The Slavs infiltrated the Balkans in small groups, eventually settling in fortified earthworks and forming tribes led by chieftains.
Their armies consisted mainly of infantry, but they developed a small cavalry retinue as they became more settled.
The Bulgars, on the other hand, were Asiatic horsemen with heavy noble cavalry and light horse archers.
The Avars, heavy bow-armed cavalry, initially allied with the Byzantines but later turned against them, ravaging the Balkans until their defeat by Emperor Maurice in 601.
The Byzantine Empire, under Justinian, reached its greatest extent by the end of the 6th century, fighting successful wars against various invaders.


In the following centuries, the Byzantine Empire spent much of its time on the defensive in the Balkans, facing invasions from the Avars and Arabs.
The Slavs occupied various regions, throwing off Avar control and engaging in intermittent wars with the Byzantines.
The Franks also made inroads into the Balkans, assisting both the Byzantines and Slavs in defeating the Avars.
The Bulgars established an independent kingdom under Isperich and later under Terbelis, defeating the Byzantines at Anchialus.
The 9th century saw the Bulgars raiding westwards and southwards, with Emperor Nicephorus sacking their capital of Pliska.
King Boris I was forced to accept Christianity, and his son Symeon fought wars with the Byzantine Empire, gaining territories in Macedonia, Thessaly, and Albania.
However, after Symeon's death, the Bulgar state declined, leading to its eventual annexation by the Byzantine Empire.


The Magyars, the last steppe people to settle in the Balkans, established themselves in Hungary under Arpad, driving the Slavs south.
They invaded Northern Italy, Germany, and France until their defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.
The Serbs and Croats also coalesced as states in the 9th century, acknowledging Byzantine suzerainty and converting to Christianity.
The Croats gained autonomy under Duke Branimir and established the Kingdom of the Croats in 925, although internal conflicts and invasions by neighboring powers led to periods of instability.


Overall, the Dark Ages in the Balkans were marked by invasions, conflicts, and the establishment of various states and kingdoms.
The Byzantine Empire played a dominant role in the region, facing threats from barbarian tribes and other external powers.
The establishment of states such as Croatia, Serbia, and Bulgaria laid the foundation for the modern Balkan region, with each group facing its own challenges and conflicts as they sought to establish and maintain their independence and autonomy.

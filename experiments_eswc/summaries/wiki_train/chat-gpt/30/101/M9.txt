7 World Trade Center is a building in New York City that has been the focus of conspiracy theories surrounding the events of September 11, 2001.
The original building, completed in 1987, was destroyed on that day and replaced with a new structure that opened in 2006.
Both buildings were developed by Larry Silverstein and were situated above a Consolidated Edison power substation.
The original building had difficulties attracting tenants until Salomon Brothers signed a long-term lease in 1988.
On September 11, 2001, the building was damaged by debris from the nearby North Tower collapse and subsequently caught fire, leading to its complete collapse at 5:21:10 p.m.
The new 7 World Trade Center, completed in 2006, was designed with an emphasis on safety and environmentally friendly features.
The collapse of 7 World Trade Center was investigated by FEMA and later by NIST, with the latter determining that the collapse was primarily caused by uncontrolled fires fueled by office contents and lack of water to fight the fires.
The collapse of 7 World Trade Center resulted in substantial damage to neighboring buildings, including the Borough of Manhattan Community College's Fiterman Hall and the Verizon Building.
The collapse also led to the destruction of SEC files and other federal investigative files housed in the building.
The collapse of 7 World Trade Center is significant as it was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires, debunking conspiracy theories of controlled demolition.

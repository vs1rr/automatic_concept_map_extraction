On September 11, 2001, prior to the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 (WTC 7), there were indications that some individuals knew in advance that the building was going to come down.
Two official accounts, Account 1 and Account 2, have been proposed to explain this foreknowledge.
Account 1 suggests that WTC 7 was damaged by debris from the collapsing WTC 1, leading to fires fueled by diesel stored in the building, which ultimately caused the collapse.
Account 2, the current official explanation, states that the impact damage and fires were not significant factors in the collapse, which was primarily due to fire-induced structural failures.


However, neither Account 1 nor Account 2 align with the evidence of foreknowledge and premature announcements of the collapse by major television networks.
Witnesses, including firefighters and reporters, expressed certainty that WTC 7 was going to collapse, with some waiting for hours for it to happen.
The Fire Department of New York had reportedly been cleared from the building hours before the collapse, indicating early knowledge of the event.
This foreknowledge contradicts the official accounts, as Account 2's explanation of last-minute internal collapse events was not witnessed by anyone.


Furthermore, premature announcements of the collapse by CNN and the BBC raise questions about the official narrative.
CNN announced the impending collapse over an hour before it occurred, with captions indicating the building was on fire and about to collapse, despite no visible signs of imminent collapse.
The BBC also announced the collapse 23 minutes prematurely, providing a version of Account 1 to explain the event, which is inconsistent with the official Account 2.


The certainty and early knowledge of the collapse of WTC 7, along with the premature announcements by major media outlets, suggest that individuals may have had prior knowledge of the building's impending collapse.
This foreknowledge supports the theory that WTC 7 was brought down through a process of controlled demolition, rather than the explanations provided in the official accounts.
The discrepancies between the evidence of foreknowledge and the official narrative raise questions about the events surrounding the collapse of WTC 7 on September 11, 2001.

7 World Trade Center is a building in Lower Manhattan, New York City, that was originally completed in 1987 and destroyed in the September 11 attacks.
The current building, developed by Larry Silverstein, opened in 2006.
The original building was tall and clad in red exterior masonry, with Salomon Brothers as the main tenants.
It collapsed on September 11, 2001, due to uncontrolled fires, making it the first steel skyscraper to collapse from fire.
The new building, completed in 2006, is the 28th tallest in New York and emphasizes safety with a reinforced concrete core and green design features.
It was the first commercial office building in NYC to receive LEED certification.
The new building's design allows for the restoration

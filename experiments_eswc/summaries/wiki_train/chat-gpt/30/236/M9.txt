Since the 16th century, Brazil had been governed by Portugal, with King Dom João VI residing in Brazil since 1808.
In 1820, Portugal experienced a revolution, leading to the demand for the king's return.
Dom Pedro was left in charge of Brazil, but faced manipulation by Portuguese military officers.
The Cortes ordered Pedro to return to Europe, sparking outrage among Brazilian inhabitants.
This led to uprisings by the Bonificans and Liberals, who wanted Brazil to remain united with Portugal.
However, as Pedro faced continued humiliation by the Cortes, he gradually shifted his loyalties to Brazil.
With the encouragement of his wife, Princess Leopoldina, Pedro announced his decision to stay in Brazil for the nation's happiness.
He dismissed Avilez and appointed Bonifácio as Minister of Kingdom and Foreign Affairs.
In September 1822, Pedro declared independence from Portugal, becoming Dom Pedro I, Constitutional Emperor of Brazil.
The official breaking of ties occurred on 22 September 1822, with Pedro being acclaimed as the leader of independent Brazil.
This marked the beginning of Brazil's journey towards independence and sovereignty.

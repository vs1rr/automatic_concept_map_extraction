In the nineteenth century, Brazil's history was heavily influenced by events in Europe, particularly Napoleon Bonaparte's conquest of the Iberian Peninsula.
When the Portuguese royal court fled to Rio de Janeiro in 1808, Dom João VI brought European-style institutions to the city.
Despite Napoleon's defeat, João did not want to return to Lisbon, preferring to stay in Brazil.
In 1821, he left his son, Prince Pedro, as regent in Brazil and returned to Europe.
When the Portuguese Cortes attempted to restore Brazil to colonial status, Pedro rejected their attempts and declared Brazil's independence on January 9, 1822, leading to the establishment of the Empire of Brazil.


Father Belchior Pinheira de Oliveira's account describes the moment of Pedro's declaration of independence, highlighting his concerns about the Portuguese government's persecution and his determination to break away from Portugal.
Pedro's declaration and his supporters' enthusiastic response indicate that there would likely be significant changes to the regime after independence.
Pedro's decision to label the new government an "empire" rather than a "kingdom" was a political one, aligning Brazil with Roman imperial history.


Debret's paintings depict the coronation of Emperor Pedro I and the separation of Brazil from Portugal, emphasizing Brazil's independence and history.
The comparison of King João VI and Emperor Pedro I reflects their different political positions, while the images of Rio de Janeiro show the city's economy and social structure.
The arrival of Princess Leopoldine reflects both European and Brazilian values, and Pedro II's assumption of leadership symbolizes the importance of the emperor to Brazilian elites.


Pedro II assumed power in 1840, ruling the Second Empire for 59 years.
Barman's book, "Citizen Emperor: Pedro II and the Making of Brazil, 1825-1891," explores Pedro II's reign and his impact on Brazil.
Overall, the events surrounding Pedro I and Pedro II shaped Brazil's history in the nineteenth century, leading to the establishment of the Empire of Brazil and the reign of Pedro II.

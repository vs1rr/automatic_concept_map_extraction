In 1612, ten people were convicted of witchcraft at the Summer Assize in Lancaster Castle and were hanged on the moors above the town.
The accused, including two men and an elderly woman, were charged with crimes such as laming, causing madness, and simple witchcraft.
Additionally, sixteen unexplained deaths were attributed to them.
The story of the Pendle Witches began in the remote Pendle Forest in Lancashire, where the accused resided.


The events leading to the trials started with a young woman named Alison Device, who, under the influence of a familiar spirit, cursed a peddler named John Law, causing him to become paralyzed.
Law's son reported the incident to a local magistrate, Roger Nowell, leading to multiple arrests.
The most famous of the accused, Elizabeth Southernes ("Old Demdike") and Anne Whittle ("Old Chattox"), admitted to being witches and implicated others, including family members.


The trials began in August 1612, with the accused facing charges of murder, causing madness, and attending a Witches Sabbath.
Witnesses, including Elizabeth Device's nine-year-old daughter Jennet, provided damning evidence against the accused.
Despite some flimsy evidence, many of the accused were found guilty and sentenced to death.


The trials also included the Samlesbury Witches, who were acquitted after claiming to be victims of a Catholic plot.
On the second day of trials, more accused witches were found guilty based on testimonies and hearsay evidence.
The sentences were handed down, and on August 20th, 1612, the ten condemned prisoners were hanged on the moors above the town.


The trials in Lancaster in 1612 are well-documented in Thomas Potts' book "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster," which provides a biased but detailed account of the events.
The trials took place during a time of political and religious tension, with anti-Catholic sentiments influencing the prosecutions.
Despite the lack of concrete evidence, ten people lost their lives due to accusations of witchcraft, a crime that no longer exists officially.


The Pendle Witch trials of 1612 remain one of the most famous witchcraft trials in history, shedding light on the superstitions and prejudices of the time.
The trials were influenced by political and religious factors, leading to the execution of ten individuals based on questionable evidence and beliefs in the supernatural.

The Borobudur Temple Compound in Indonesia is a significant ancient Buddhist monument, built in the 8th and 9th centuries by the Sailendra dynasty.
The temple consists of three monuments, with the main Borobudur temple being the largest Buddhist temple in the world.
Over the centuries, the temple was abandoned and covered in volcanic ash and vegetation.
In the 19th century, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles initiated an excavation of the site, leading to further deterioration due to exposure to the elements and theft of artifacts.
In 1948, the Indonesian government prioritized the preservation of Borobudur, leading to a restoration project in collaboration with UNESCO.
The restoration involved dismantling the lower terraces to clean and treat each stone individually, as well as cleaning and treating the relief panels.
After eight years and $25 million, the restoration was completed.
Ongoing conservation efforts are necessary to protect the temple, such as covering the stupas during volcanic eruptions.
The fact that a predominantly Muslim country like Indonesia values and protects this Buddhist monument highlights its cultural and historical significance.
Borobudur serves as an iconic symbol of Indonesia's rich history and heritage, showcasing the country's diverse religious and cultural past.

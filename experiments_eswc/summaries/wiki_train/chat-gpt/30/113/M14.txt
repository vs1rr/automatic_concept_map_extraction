Borobudur is a Buddhist stupa and temple complex in Central Java, Indonesia dating from the 8th century, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It is the largest Buddhist structure in the world and is set in the verdant Kedu Plain with active volcanoes in the backdrop.
The history of Borobudur is shrouded in mystery, with theories suggesting it was built as a religious site during the Sailendra dynasty in the 8th century.
The monument was abandoned and hidden for centuries before being rediscovered by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1814.
The restoration of Borobudur began in the early 20th century and was completed in 1983, leading to its designation as a World Heritage Site in 1991.
The site has since become a major tourist attraction, attracting millions of visitors each year.
The 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi and the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake caused damage to Borobudur, but restoration efforts have been ongoing.
Visitors are advised to be respectful of the site's religious significance and to follow guidelines to protect the monument from vandalism and wear and tear.
Nearby attractions include the Hindu temples of Prambanan, the cultural city of Yogyakarta, and the Dieng Plateau.

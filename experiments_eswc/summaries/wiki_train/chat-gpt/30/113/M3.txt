The text describes a visit to a monastery where a monk introduces visitors to Buddhism, explaining the rules and practices followed by the monks.
The monk also gives a tour of the monastery, showing structures representing different stages in the Buddha's quest for Enlightenment.
After a meditation session, the visitors also visit Borobudur Temple, a Mahayana Buddhist temple from the 9th Century.
The temple had been buried for thousands of years before being rediscovered and restored.
The temple has different levels symbolizing the stages required to reach enlightenment, with stone carvings illustrating stories on each level.
The visit to the monastery and the temple provided insight into Buddhism in two different settings - the quiet and serene monastery and the bustling historic landsite of Borobudur.
The experience was described as the best day so far, offering a unique opportunity to learn about the same religion in contrasting environments.

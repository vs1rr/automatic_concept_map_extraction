Brougham Castle in Cumbria was built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vieuxpont and is strategically located between the rivers Lowther and Eamont.
The castle was initially confiscated by the Crown in 1264 but later returned to the de Vieuxpont family.
It came into the ownership of the de Clifford family in 1269 through marriage.
The castle saw improvements in defense during the Anglo-Scottish War in 1296.
Robert de Clifford, who held the title of Lord of the Marches, played a significant role in the castle's history.
The castle was captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388 and eventually fell into disrepair by 1592.
Lady Anne Clifford, the last member of the Clifford family to live at the castle, inherited it in 1643 and underwent a period of restoration.
The castle eventually passed into state ownership in the 1930s and is now managed by English Heritage, open to the public for visits

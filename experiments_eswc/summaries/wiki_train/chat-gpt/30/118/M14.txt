Brough Castle, located on the edge of Brough and overlooking the A66, is a historic site dating back to 1090.
Built on the ruins of a Roman fort called Verteris, the castle was initially constructed by William Rufus as a defense against the Scots.
It was later taken by the Scots in 1136 but retaken by the English in 1157.
The castle saw further conflict in 1173/4 when it was besieged by the Scottish king, William the Lion.
Restoration work was carried out in the late 12th century and major renovations were done in the early 13th century by Robert de Vipont.
The castle passed through various owners, including the Clifford family, until it was destroyed by a fire in 1521.
Lady Anne Clifford initiated restoration works in the 17th century, and the castle is now cared for

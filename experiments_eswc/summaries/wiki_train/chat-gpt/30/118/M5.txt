Brougham Castle, built in the 13th century on the site of a former Roman fort, was strategically located at the confluence of two rivers to defend against enemies.
It was initially built by Robert de Vieuxpont and later strengthened by the Clifford family.
The castle played a role in the Anglo-Scottish wars and the War of the Roses.
After falling into disuse, Lady Anne Clifford revived the castle in the 17th century.
However, it eventually fell into ruin and inspired William Wordsworth's poem 'The Prelude'.
The government took ownership in 1928, and English Heritage has been preserving the site since 1984.
The castle is open to visitors during the summer months.

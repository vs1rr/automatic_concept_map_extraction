Bellmans Auctioneers will be selling some of the contents of Bramshill House, a historic mansion in Hampshire, at their May auction.
The collection includes unique pieces such as a massive elm and oak refectory table, oak triple sconce candelabras by Robert 'Mouseman' Thompson, and oak ceremonial armchairs commissioned for Her Majesty the Queen and HRH Prince Phillip.
The auction will take place over four days in May, with online bidding available.
Bellmans Saleroom Manager, Will Pasfield, is excited to oversee the auction process and highlights the exceptional quality of the items being sold.
The auction will be fully illustrated online, and interested buyers can contact Bellmans Auctioneers directly for more information.
The sale of these items comes after the relocation of the police facilities from Bramshill House, making this a unique opportunity for collectors and history enthusiasts to acquire pieces from this historic location.

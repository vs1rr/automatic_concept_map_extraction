Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, was an English diplomat known for his lone vote against the condemnation of Mary, Queen of Scots, and for organizing a stag-hunt where the Archbishop of Canterbury accidentally killed a man.
He was born in 1556 to George la Zouche, 10th Baron Zouche, and
Margaret Welby. Zouche married Eleanor Zouche in 1578, but abandoned her shortly after the birth of their second daughter, Mary.
He later married Sarah Harrington.
Zouche had a varied career, serving as an Ambassador to Scotland, Lord President of the Council of Wales, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.
He was also involved in the Virginia Company and had a strong interest in horticulture.
Zouche purchased Bramshill Manor in 1605 and built a mansion there.
In 1625, he died after a period of illness, and his burial place is unknown.
The Barony of Zouche fell into abeyance after his death, eventually being restored in 1815 to Cecil Bisshopp.
Zouche was involved in a case concerning Samuel More, his secretary, and four children who traveled to America on the Mayflower in 1620.
Zouche provided counsel in this incident, where the children were sent as indentured servants to the Colony of Virginia.
Three of the children died during the first winter, with only one surviving.
Zouche held various offices throughout his career, including Ambassador to Scotland, Deputy Governor of Guernsey, and Commissioner for the Virginia Company.
He was also a Privy Counsellor and involved in various commissions and inquiries.
Zouche's legacy includes his diplomatic work, involvement in the Virginia Company, and the mysterious case of the More children on the Mayflower.

Bramshill House is a historic mansion located in Bramshill, northeast Hampshire, England.
It is situated at the approximate center of a triangular shape formed by Reading, Basingstoke, and Farnborough, about 47 miles southwest of central London.
The original house was built between 1351 and 1360 by Sir John Foxley, Baron of the Exchequer, and has a rich history of ownership by various families over the centuries.
In the early 17th century, Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, purchased the property and began building the Bramshill House that stands today.
The mansion is considered one of the largest and most important Jacobean prodigy house mansions in England, with a design influenced by the Italian Renaissance.


The architecture of Bramshill House is described as a "glory of English architecture" by historians Anthony Blunt and James Lees-Milne.
The three-storey building is approximately 140 feet in length and features a symmetrical exterior with red brick laid in English bond dressed with stone.
The mansion has a unique layout, with projecting wings at either end of the eastern and western sides.
The north façade includes a loggia with a central arched entrance, while the southern façade is noted for its fanciful Jacobean design.
The interior of the mansion is richly furnished with period pieces, including large tapestries depicting historical figures and scenes.
The Great Hall features a Jacobean stone screen adorned with 92 shields representing the arms of ancestors and family members.


The mansion's grounds cover 262 acres and include an 18-acre lake.
The estate received a Grade II* listing in 1984 and is part of a Registered Historic Park with about 25 acres of early 17th-century formal gardens.
Bramshill House has been a local sporting and social venue since the 16th century, hosting cricket matches and other events.
During the Second World War, the mansion served as a Red Cross maternity home and later became the residence of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania.
In 1960, the property was acquired by the British government and became the location of the National Police College.
It later housed the European Police College until 2014 when it was sold to heritage property developers City & Country.


Despite its historical significance, Bramshill House faced challenges with escalating maintenance costs, leading to its sale in 2014.
The property has been the subject of various reports and controversies, including criticism for lavish spending on renovations and maintenance.
The mansion is also said to be haunted by 14 ghosts, including the spirit of a bride who locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later.


Overall, Bramshill House stands as a testament to English architecture and history, with its grand design, rich furnishings, and storied past making it a significant landmark in Hampshire.

Matthew Johnson, a Professor at Northwestern University, focuses on landscape archaeology, seeking to understand human life and change in past societies.
He emphasizes the importance of careful observation and questioning in this field.
Johnson's research explores the transition from medieval to early modern rural landscapes, examining changes in agricultural and social organization.
In his lecture on "How Castles Work," Johnson challenges the traditional view of castles as solely military structures, arguing that they also served as social and political centers.
He highlights Bodiam Castle as an example of a castle built for more than just defense, with its strategic location and elaborate designed landscape.
Johnson's research at Bodiam, in collaboration with the National Trust, aims to move beyond the military/social debate and explore the castle in its regional context.
He has written books on castles and landscape archaeology, with a new book on castles in progress.
Johnson's work sheds light on the multifaceted roles of castles in medieval society, emphasizing their economic and social functions alongside their military significance.

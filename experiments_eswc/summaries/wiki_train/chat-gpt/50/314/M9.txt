The CSI Effect refers to the influence of crime television shows on jurors, leading them to demand more forensic evidence in criminal trials.
Jurors with higher expectations for forensic science may not convict guilty individuals if procedures from TV shows are not applied.
This phenomenon has led to unnecessary and expensive tests being requested in court, impacting both prosecution and defense.
The increased demand for forensic evidence has also inflated workloads for crime laboratories.
Jurors now expect advanced technology and scientific evidence in every criminal case, despite the fact that successful prosecution or defense can occur with other important evidence.
It is important to remember that no single piece of evidence should solely determine guilt or innocence, but rather the overall examination of various pieces of evidence.
The Forensic Trends in Health Care conference, featuring Paul Clements, PhD, as a keynote speaker, will address these issues.

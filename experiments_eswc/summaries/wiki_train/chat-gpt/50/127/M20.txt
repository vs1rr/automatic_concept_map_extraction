Gothic castles have been a source of fascination for centuries, with the term 'gothic' originally referring to a style of architecture popular in the middle of Medieval times.
This style featured grand arched buildings with sweeping windows, such as those found in many cathedrals in Europe.
In the 1700s, 'gothic' took on a new meaning with the rise of gothic novels, which aimed to evoke feelings of fear and terror in readers.
These novels were set in evocative, crumbling old castles, abbeys, and manors, creating an atmosphere of spookiness and desolation.

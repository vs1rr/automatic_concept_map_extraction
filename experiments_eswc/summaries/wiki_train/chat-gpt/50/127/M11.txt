Castles have been a significant part of European history, serving both offensive and defensive military purposes as well as being important social centers.
Originally built from earth and timber, castles were later replaced by stone fortifications to increase their strength.
As the nobility accumulated wealth, England became a target for plunder, leading to the need for improved castle defenses such as arrow-slits, towers, and multiple walls.
The introduction of gunpowder in the 14th century ultimately led to the demise of traditional castles, as artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls.
Despite their decline in military importance, castles continue to attract millions of visitors each year as majestic remnants of a bygone era.

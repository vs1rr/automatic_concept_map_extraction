Medieval warfare during the Middle Ages was much more complex than the popular notion of knights charging across open fields.
Siegecraft played a significant role in warfare, with castle sieges becoming a common occurrence.
The process of besieging a castle involved careful planning, assembling an army, gathering supplies, and utilizing various siege engines such as mangonels, ballistas, and trebuchets.
The goal of a siege was to force the garrison to surrender through a combination of tactics, including escalades, mining, and blockades.
Negotiation, bribery, and intimidation were also common methods used to end a siege without bloodshed.
The use of cannons in the late fourteenth century began to change the dynamics of siege warfare, leading to the eventual decline of castles as military strongholds.
Despite this, the conventions of siege warfare established during the Middle Ages continue to influence military strategy to this day.

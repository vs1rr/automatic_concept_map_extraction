Castles were built in Europe during Medieval times as fortified structures to defend the country from foreign invaders and symbolize power.
They were also used as residences for lords and their families, preserving their power over the land.
The emergence of a social and military elite in the Carolingian Empire led to the construction of castles in the ninth and tenth centuries.
When the Carolingian Empire fell, local lords took on the responsibility of economy and justice, leading to the appearance of castles.
The first castles were made of wood in the 11th century, but later castles were made of stone for better fortification.
Castles were built by lords or nobles to protect against enemies and provide a safe place for themselves and their peasants.
The keep, a strong tower within the castle, was the last place of refuge if the outer defenses fell.
Guards were posted throughout the castle, with the keep being the most heavily guarded spot.
Castles were ruled by lords or nobles, while palaces were built for luxury and not fortified.
Moats were defensive ditches used to stop siege towers from reaching the castle walls.
The advantage of castle warfare was that defenders did not have to march out to a battlefield, and enemies faced difficulties breaching the castle's defenses.
Overall, castles were important structures in medieval Europe for defense, power, and residence.

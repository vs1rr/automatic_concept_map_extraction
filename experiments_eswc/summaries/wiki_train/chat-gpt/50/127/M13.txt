Tower houses were a type of castle built during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries in Europe.
They served as homes for the king or lord, as defensive structures, and as administrative centers.
Tower houses were simple, functional, and cost-effective for defense against neighbors and enemies.
They were commonly rectangular, three to four stories high, with basic moldings around windows and doors.
The ground floor was used for storage, the first floor for a hall, and upper floors for private chambers.
Tower houses were more common in northern England and the borders, where security was a concern.
Examples of surviving tower houses in England include Sizergh, Arnside Tower, and Stokesay Castle.
In Scotland, tower houses were larger and more elaborate, with features like corbelled bartizans and steep ridge roofs.
Notable Scottish tower houses include Hallbar, Craigievar Castle, and Craigmillar Castle.
In Ireland, tower houses were primarily built by wealthy landowners for protection, administration, and social gatherings.
Examples of Irish tower houses include Kinlough Castle, Dunguire Castle, and Bunratty Castle.
Tower houses were also popular in France, Italy, and Central Europe, with examples like the towers of San Gimignano in Italy and the tower house of Chevenon in France.
The ducal tower at Siedlecin in Poland is one of the best-preserved examples in Central Europe, featuring original medieval architecture and murals depicting Sir Lancelot of the Lake.
Tower houses are a testament to medieval life, combining political, social, and artistic history in one structure.

Pembroke Castle has a long history dating back to 1093 when Arnulf de Montgomery built the small inner bailey.
The castle withstood a siege by the Welsh and was later reconstructed in stone by William Marshall in the late 12th/early 13th centuries.
The castle features a unique cylindrical tower with a stone dome, a complex gatehouse with three portcullises, and a natural cavern known as the Wogan.
It is also the birthplace of Henry VII.
During the English Civil War, the castle was attacked by both Royalists and Roundheads.
Today, Pembroke Castle is owned by a Private Charitable Trust and efforts have been made to bring its history to life through exhibitions and tableaux.
The castle is open all year, with a gift shop, cafe, and Brass Rubbing Centre available during the summer months.
Visitors can explore the castle's history from its beginnings to the present day, including the birth of Henry VII.
Overall, Pembroke Castle is a fascinating historical site with a rich and tumultuous past that continues to be preserved and shared with visitors.

The Pendle Witch trials in 1612 were among the most famous in English history, with twelve accused of using witchcraft to murder ten people.
Nine women and two men were tried, with ten found guilty and executed.
The trials, documented in Thomas Potts' "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster," were unusual for England at the time, with more than two percent of all English witch trial executions attributed to this case.
Six of the accused came from two families, led by elderly women.
Accusations stemmed from competition between families trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion.
The outbreaks of witchcraft in Pendle highlight how people could profit from posing as witches.
The trials shed light on the superstitions and fears of the time, resulting in a significant number of executions compared to other witch trials in England during that period.

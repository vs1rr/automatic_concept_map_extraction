A statue of Alice Nutter, one of the Pendle witches accused of murder by witchcraft in 1612, will be placed in Roughlee to commemorate the 400th anniversary of her death.
The statue will be located on Blacko Bar Road on ground donated by a descendant of Nutter.
The parish council has asked interested artists to design the statue, with strict guidelines to celebrate Nutter as a resident unfairly treated in 1612.
Nutter was perceived as different from the other accused witches due to her wealth and lack of defense during her trial.
She was found guilty and executed at Lancaster Castle.
The statue is expected to be completed by April 2012.
The goal of the statue is to raise awareness of the true story of the Pendle witches and to move on from Nutter's image as a witch.

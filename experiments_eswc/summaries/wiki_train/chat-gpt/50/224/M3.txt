The California Gold Rush was a period of mass hysteria and migration in American history, sparked by the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848.
People from around the world, known as the "49ers," flocked to California in search of fortune, but most only found enough gold to cover daily expenses.
The rush led to significant development in California, including the building of the Panama Railway.
San Francisco initially became a ghost town as people left for the gold fields, but later boomed as miners returned, often broke and seeking work.
The influx of people strained infrastructure and led to crime, prompting the rise of vigilantes.
The Gold Rush is considered to have ended in 1858 with the start of the New Mexican Gold Rush.
The San Francisco 49ers NFL team is named after the prospectors of this historic event.

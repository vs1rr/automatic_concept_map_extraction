The California Gold Rush began in 1848 when gold was discovered at Sutter's Lumber Mill in Coloma, California, attracting 300,000 prospectors known as "forty-niners" in search of wealth.
In 1852 alone, $80 million worth of gold was extracted.
The discovery occurred before Mexico ceded California to the United States in 1848.
President James Polk was in office during this time, and the Gold Rush was a significant event during his presidency.
The California Gold Rush map shows the locations of key discoveries, including Sutter's Mill, Mormon Island, Bidwell's Bar, Weber's Creek, and Rich Bar.
The Gold Rush had a major impact on the history and development of California and the United States.

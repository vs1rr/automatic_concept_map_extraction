Stephen Hill, an African American slave, escaped from his owner, Owen Rozier, in 1854 during the Gold Rush.
Hill's white neighbors, known as the Gold Spring Boys, helped him escape as they did not believe he was Rozier's property.
Despite California being a free state, federal laws allowed Rozier to capture Hill and return him to Arkansas.
Slavery was not uncommon in the California mines, with slave owners and slaves coming primarily from western U.S. states.
California's statehood was a contentious issue, with delegates ultimately declaring it a free state in 1849.
The Compromise of 1850 allowed California to enter the Union under the terms of the state delegates, but did not extend civil rights to African Americans or Native Americans.
California passed its own version of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1852, allowing white slave owners to reclaim escaped black slaves.
The Monterey delegates who made California a free state did so based on the mining economy, not out of anti-racism.
Despite the tensions surrounding slavery and statehood, California's entry into the Union helped maintain the unity of the nation.

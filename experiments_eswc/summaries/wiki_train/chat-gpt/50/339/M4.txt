The Alien and Sedition Acts were a series of four bills passed by the Federalist-dominated 5th United States Congress and signed into law by President John Adams in 1798.
These acts made it harder for immigrants to become citizens, allowed the president to imprison and deport non-citizens deemed dangerous, and criminalized making false statements critical of the federal government.
The Federalists argued that these acts strengthened national security during an undeclared naval war with France, while critics viewed them as an attempt to suppress voters who disagreed with the Federalist party and a violation of freedom of speech.
Three of the acts were repealed after Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican party came to power, but the Alien Enemies Act remained in effect and was used in World War I and World War II to imprison and deport aliens from hostile nations.
The Sedition Act resulted in the prosecution and conviction of many Jeffersonian newspaper owners who disagreed with the government.
The acts were denounced by Democratic-Republicans and ultimately helped them win the 1800 election.
The Alien Enemies Act remains in effect today and has been used in various ways throughout history, including during World War II and in response to the 9/11 attacks.
The Alien and Sedition Acts were controversial then and remain so today, with opposition resulting in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions authored by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.
The acts were never appealed to the Supreme Court, and subsequent mentions in Supreme Court opinions have assumed that the Sedition Act would be found unconstitutional today.
The Alien Enemies Acts remained in effect during World War I and were used by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during World War II to intern Japanese, German, and Italian non-citizens.
The acts have continued to be relevant in the 20th and 21st centuries, with President Donald Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States drawing comparisons to Roosevelt's use of the Alien Enemies Act.
Critics have argued that the proposal violates founding principles and is unconstitutional for singling out a religion rather than a hostile nation.

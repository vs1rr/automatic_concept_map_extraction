He attended the College of New Jersey at Princeton, where he was exposed to the ideas of the Scottish Enlightenment.
After returning home, Madison became involved in politics, serving in the Virginia Convention of 1776 and the Virginia House of Delegates.
He was elected to the Continental Congress in 1779 and played a key role in shaping the new Constitution at the Constitutional Convention in 1787.
Madison also played a crucial role in getting the Constitution ratified, co-authoring The Federalist papers.
He served in the U.S. House of Representatives and was instrumental in the passage of the Bill of Rights.
Madison later served as Secretary of State under Thomas Jefferson and was elected as the fourth President of the United States in 1808.
His presidency was marked by the War of 1812 against Great Britain, which ended with the Treaty of Ghent in 1814.
Madison retired to his plantation in Virginia in 1817 and remained active in public life until his death in 1836.

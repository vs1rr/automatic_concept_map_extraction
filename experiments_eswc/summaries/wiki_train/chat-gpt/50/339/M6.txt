The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 were influential statements passed by the state legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia, written by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively.
These resolutions were in opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts passed by Congress during the Quasi War with France.
The resolutions established the theory of nullification and interposition, claiming that individual states could nullify federal laws deemed unconstitutional.
However, the resolutions were overwhelmingly rejected by other states, with some even viewing them as military threats.
The Alien and Sedition Acts were eventually repealed after Jefferson was elected president.
The resolutions became central to the beliefs of Jefferson's party and were used as party documents in the 1800 election.
They later became landmark documents supporting the concept of states' rights and were invoked during the Nullification Crisis of 1832.
The ideas underlying the resolutions also influenced Southern secession in the 1860s, leading to the American Civil War.
However, these ideas were decisively rejected during the Civil War and did not resurface afterwards.
The authorship of Jefferson and Madison remained secret for years, and the resolutions were met with counter-resolutions from other states.
Overall, the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 had a significant impact on the concept of states' rights in American history.

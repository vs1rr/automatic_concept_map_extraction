The idea of nullification, which allows states to reject federal laws deemed unconstitutional, has been circulating among state legislators.
While Thomas Jefferson endorsed nullification in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, James Madison's Virginia Resolution only supports the theory of interposition, where states express dissatisfaction with federal laws and push for repeal.
Madison explicitly opposed nullification during the Nullification Crisis under Andrew Jackson's presidency.
Alexander Hamilton also criticized nullification, as it goes against the Constitution and could lead to a neo-confederate form of government.
Nullification contradicts the purpose of the Constitution and Article VI, which establishes federal law as supreme.
States have other legal means to oppose unconstitutional legislation, such as filing lawsuits, and should avoid the chaotic and unconstitutional path of nullification.

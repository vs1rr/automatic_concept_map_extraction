A protectorate is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state.
In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly depending on the real nature of their relationship.
Protectorates are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of.
A state that remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates.


Amical protection involves terms that are often very favorable for the protectorate.
The political interest of the protector is frequently moral or countering a rival or enemy power.
In modern times, a form of amical protection can be seen as an important feature of microstates.
Colonial protection conditions are generally much less generous for areas of colonial protection.
Protectorates were often reduced to a de facto condition similar to a colony, but using the pre-existing native state as an agent of indirect rule.
Foreign relations of a protectorate often involve direct relations only with the protecting power, and the protectorate relies on the protector for its defense.


British protectorates were territories that were not formally annexed but in which the Crown had ultimate power and jurisdiction.
Some British colonies were ruled directly by the Colonial Office in London, while others were ruled indirectly through local rulers who were supervised behind the scenes by British advisors.
The British established protectorates in various regions, including Africa, Asia, and Oceania.
The last British protectorate proper was Solomon Islands, which gained independence in 1978, while the last British protected state was Brunei, which gained full independence in 1984.


French protectorates were established in regions such as Asia, the Arab world, Madagascar, and sub-Saharan Africa.
The legal regime of "protection" was the formal legal structure under which French colonial forces expanded in Africa between the 1830s and 1900.
Almost every pre-existing state in the area later covered by French West Africa was placed under protectorate status at some point, although direct rule gradually replaced protectorate agreements.
French protectorates were often colonial and involved various traditional states and kingdoms.


Other countries, such as Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, Spain, and the United States, also established protectorates in different regions around the world.
The United States, for example, had protectorates in Liberia, Cuba, Panama Canal Zone, Honduras, Nicaragua, and other areas.
The United Nations has also been involved in establishing protectorates in regions such as West Papua, Cambodia, East Timor, and Kosovo.


Overall, protectorates have played a significant role in international relations and colonial history, with various countries establishing protectorates in different regions for political, economic, and strategic reasons.
The concept of protectorates continues to be relevant in contemporary international relations, with some territories still considered protectorates or under the protection of a greater sovereign state.

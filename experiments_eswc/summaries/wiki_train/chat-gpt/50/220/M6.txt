The East India Company was a key player in the formation of the British Empire, initially established for trading but later expanding its influence through military alliances and commercial access in India.
The company developed trade routes that dominated commerce between Britain and Asia, bringing cultural and economic changes to both regions.
The company's armed forces played a significant role in representing British interests and maintaining control in India.
However, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, many Indians rose up against British authority, leading to immense human suffering and ultimately the dissolution of the East India Company in 1858.
Following this, the administration of India became the responsibility of the Crown.
The East India Company's legacy includes its contributions to British life, such as introducing tea from China, as well as its role in shaping the British Empire through trade and military expansion in Asia.

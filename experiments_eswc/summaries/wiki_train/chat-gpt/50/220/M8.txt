The British Empire was the largest empire in history, spanning a quarter of the world and making the United Kingdom the most powerful country for over a century.
It began in the 17th century and included dominions, colonies, protectorates, and mandates ruled by the UK.
By the 1920s, it had 458 million people and covered a quarter of the Earth's land surface.
The empire was known as 'the empire on which the sun never sets' due to its vast reach.
English became the world's most common international language due to British influence.
The empire was built after other European powers like Portugal and Spain had already begun colonizing the Americas.
England joined the race for colonies to avoid becoming weaker and poorer.
By the 18th century, Britain had defeated France and the Netherlands, becoming the main colonial power in North America and India.
However, the empire faced setbacks, such as losing the American colonies and valuable resources.
Britain then turned its attention to Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.
The empire could not be held together by force, leading to the self-governing dominions.
After World War II, Britain was unable to control its colonies, leading to a wave of independence movements.
India gained independence in 1947, followed by African countries in the 1960s.
The end of the empire led to tensions, such as the split of India into India and Pakistan.
Many newly independent nations remained part of the Commonwealth, with Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state.
The empire's decline was accelerated by the two world wars, which drained Britain of money and allowed the United States to become a more powerful industrial nation.
Ultimately, the British Empire's inability to maintain control over its colonies led to their independence and the dissolution of the empire.

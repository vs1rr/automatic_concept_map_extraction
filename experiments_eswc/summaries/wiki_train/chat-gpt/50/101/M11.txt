On September 11, 2001, prior to the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7, many individuals had foreknowledge that the building was going to come down.
This foreknowledge was supported by premature announcements of the collapse by major television networks.
The official accounts of the collapse, known as Account 1 and Account 2, provide differing explanations for the events leading to the collapse.
Account 1 suggests that the building was critically damaged by debris from the collapsing WTC 1, causing structural damage and fires.
Account 2, the current official account, states that the impact damage and fires were not significant factors in the collapse, which was primarily due to fire triggering a unique sequence of events inside the building.
However, neither account aligns with the evidence of early and certain collapse predictions made by witnesses on the scene.
Firefighters and other individuals were confident that WTC 7 was going to collapse, with some having this foreknowledge hours in advance.
The premature announcements of the collapse by CNN and the BBC further contradict the official accounts.
This foreknowledge of the collapse suggests that the building was brought down through a process of controlled demolition, as supported by previous evidence.

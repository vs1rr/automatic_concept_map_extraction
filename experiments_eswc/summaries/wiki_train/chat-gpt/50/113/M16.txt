Indonesian police have increased security at the Borobudur Temple, the world's largest Buddhist temple and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, after a threat was made by Islamic State supporters on Facebook.
The threat, posted on August 15, stated that the temple would be demolished by Islamic militants.
In response, police in Central Java province are investigating the threat and working with temple security and the Indonesian Military to protect the site.
The Borobudur Conservation Agency has also increased security personnel in and around the temple.
The Indonesian army is also involved in ensuring the safety of the temple.
This is not the first time Borobudur has been targeted, as it was bombed in 1985 by Muslim radicals.
The temple, built in the IX century, is a key tourist attraction and pilgrimage site for Mahayana Buddhists.
It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1991.
Security was also tightened at other Java places of worship last year after a bombing at a Buddhist temple in Jakarta.
The Indonesian government is taking these threats seriously and is working to protect the cultural and religious heritage of the country.

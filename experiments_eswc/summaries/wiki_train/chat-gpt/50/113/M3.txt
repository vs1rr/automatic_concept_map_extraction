The text describes a visit to a monastery where a monk introduces visitors to Buddhism, explaining the rules and practices followed by the monks.
The monk also answers personal questions about his own conversion to Buddhism and daily life at the monastery.
After the introduction, the visitors are given a tour of the monastery, learning about the different stages in the Buddha's quest for Enlightenment.
The tour includes a meditation session and general advice from the monk.
The visitors then visit Borobudur Temple, a Mahayana Buddhist temple from the 9th Century, which had been buried for thousands of years before being rediscovered and restored.
The temple has different levels symbolizing the stages required to reach enlightenment, with stone carvings illustrating stories.
The tour guide explains the stories on each level, and the visitors enjoy the stunning view from the top of the temple.
The contrast between the quiet, serene monastery and the bustling historic landsite of Borobudur provides an interesting perspective on the same religion.
Overall, the visit to both the monastery and Borobudur Temple is described as the best day so far.

The Borobudur Temple Compounds in Indonesia is a ninth-century Mahayana Buddhist monument that contains numerous Buddhist statues, including the Buddha Image Sitting in Open Chamber.
The temple represents Buddhist cosmology with its six square platforms and three circular platforms on top.
The main dome at the center of the top platform is surrounded by 72 Buddhist statues.
The temple was abandoned due to the decline of Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms in Java and was hidden beneath volcanic ash for many centuries until its rediscovery in 1814.
The Buddha statue in the chamber is seated in a circular platform made of stone, with intricate details such as hand gestures, closed eyes, and long ears.
The statue is in good condition despite some discoloration and erosion.
The temple compounds were used for worship by Buddhists on pilgrimages, with the three tiers symbolizing the three stages of Buddhist cosmology.
The Buddha statue's mudra, known as the Gesture of Turning the Wheel of Dharma, conveys messages of wisdom, method, and faith to achieve enlightenment.
The statue's placement before the top platform, representing the world of formlessness, serves as a reminder to pilgrims of their spiritual journey.
Understanding the context and symbolism of the statue provides insight into the culture and beliefs of Buddhists in the 8th and 9th centuries.

On September 7, 1822, Dom Pedro I declared Brazil's independence from Portugal, marking the beginning of the Brazilian Empire.
Portugal had previously neglected Brazil, focusing on other colonies for profit.
The Portuguese Crown controlled Brazil through resource extraction and strict trade regulations.
However, with Napoleon's invasion of Portugal in 1808, the Portuguese court moved to Rio de Janeiro, making Brazil the center of the empire.
This led to a period of growth in education, culture, and commerce in Brazil.
When Jo√£o VI returned to Portugal in 1821, his son Pedro I remained in Brazil as regent.
Tensions rose as Portuguese elites tried to reassert control over the colony.
Brazilian elites, who had enjoyed political power, resisted this change.
Inspired by independence movements in Spanish America, Pedro I declared Brazil's independence on September 7, 1822, with the famous phrase "Independence or Death!"
Despite the heroic portrayal of the declaration, Pedro I was reportedly suffering from diarrhea at the time.
Portugal did not resist, and Brazil peacefully gained independence, becoming the only Latin American country to do so without warfare.
Brazil also became the only monarchy in Latin America after independence.

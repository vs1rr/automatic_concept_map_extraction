The history of Brazilian law can be traced back to the 1824 Constitution, which was established after Brazil gained independence from Portugal.
This constitution, also known as Constituiҫão Política do Império do Brasil, governed the country for six decades and established a constitutional monarchy with Emperor Pedro I as the ruler.
The constitution included a unique fourth branch called the Poder Moderador, which allowed Pedro I to centralize power for his benefit.
Pedro II succeeded his father and initiated the Segundo Reinado, during which slavery was gradually abolished.
In 1889, Pedro II was forced into exile, leading to the establishment of the República Velha and the adoption of the 1891 Constitution, which was heavily influenced by the United States' Constitution.
This constitution established a republican government, federalism, and a presidential system.
The 1934 Constitution reflected Germany's Weimar Constitution and focused on social rights and democratic principles.
However, the 1937 Constitution, enacted by President Vargas, centralized power in the hands of the President and was authoritarian in nature.
The 1946 Constitution restored basic individual rights, but the military coup of 1964 led to the enactment of the 1967 Constitution, which further centralized power in the executive branch.
The 1969 Constitution, considered a new constitution by many, intensified the concentration of power in the executive and restricted civil liberties.
Finally, the 1988 Constitution, known as the "Citizens' Constitution," transitioned Brazil to a democracy and provided a period of institutional stability.
This constitution ensured the direct election of chief executives and established a comprehensive list of individual rights and guarantees, including the right to access justice.

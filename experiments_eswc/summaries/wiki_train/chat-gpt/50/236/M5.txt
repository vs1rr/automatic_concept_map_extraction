In the nineteenth century, Brazil's history was heavily influenced by events in Europe, particularly Napoleon Bonaparte's conquest of much of continental Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula.
When Napoleon's forces threatened Portugal, the royal court fled to Rio de Janeiro in 1808, where Dom Jo達o VI established a court.
Despite Napoleon's defeat, Jo達o did not want to return to Portugal and instead elevated Brazil to a monarchy, making himself ruler of two nations.
In 1821, Jo達o left his son, Prince Pedro, as regent in Brazil and returned to Europe.
Pedro's refusal to obey an order from Parliament to return to Portugal led to Brazil's independence, with Pedro officially declaring independence on January 9, 1822.
His supporters, including Father Belchior, expressed enthusiasm for the independence declaration.
Pedro's decision matched public opinion among Brazilian landowners and bureaucrats, leading to the establishment of the Empire of Brazil.
The transition to independence was relatively peaceful, with no war or overthrow of the government.


Pedro's declaration of independence and his supporters' response indicated that there would likely be no significant changes to the existing socio-economic order after independence.
The decision to label the new government an "empire" rather than a "kingdom" was a political one, aligning Brazil with the divine mandate of Roman emperors.
Pedro's coronation as Emperor Pedro I was depicted in a grand, theatrical manner by artists like Debret, emphasizing Brazil's separate identity and history.
The presence of diverse peoples in the painting symbolized Brazil's past and the country's adoption of imperial history.
The equestrian statue of Pedro I and the imperial coat of arms further reinforced Brazil's imperial identity.


Comparing portraits of King Jo達o VI and Emperor Pedro I revealed differences in attire reflecting their political positions.
The images of Rio de Janeiro by Debret showcased the city's economy and social structure, with one image focusing on the palace and the other on the coastline.
The arrival of Princess Leopoldine highlighted the European and Brazilian values in the Brazilian monarchy, with a blend of European architecture and Brazilian setting and people.
Pedro II's assumption of leadership as a child, with regents ruling until he came of age, was supported by Brazilian elites to maintain the symbolic importance of the emperor.
The acclamation of Pedro II as the new leader reflected the desire to preserve the status quo and avoid political tumult.


Overall, Brazil's transition to independence and establishment of the Empire of Brazil in the nineteenth century was influenced by European events and shaped by the decisions of the royal family.
The country's adoption of imperial history and the preservation of the monarchy were important aspects of Brazil's identity during this period.

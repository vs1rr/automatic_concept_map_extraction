Since the 16th century, Brazil had been governed by Portugal, with King Dom Jo√£o VI residing in Brazil since 1808.
In 1820, Portugal experienced a Constitutional Revolution, leading to the demand for the king's return.
Dom Pedro was left in charge of Brazil when his father returned to Portugal, but faced manipulation by Portuguese military officers.
The Cortes subordinated Brazil to Portugal, sparking outrage among the Brazilian inhabitants.
This led to uprisings by the Bonificans and Liberals, who wanted Brazil to remain united with Portugal as a sovereign monarchy.
As Dom Pedro faced continued humiliation by the Cortes, he gradually shifted his loyalties to Brazil.
With the encouragement of his wife, Princess Leopoldina, Pedro announced his decision to stay in Brazil for the nation's happiness.
He dismissed Avilez and pledged loyalty to the Brazilian cause, leading to the official declaration of independence on 22 September 1822.
Dom Pedro was acclaimed as the Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil on 12 October 1822.

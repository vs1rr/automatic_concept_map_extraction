Lady Anne Clifford was a determined and influential woman who spent her life restoring castles and churches in Penrith and the surrounding area.
Despite being denied her inheritance initially, she eventually regained control of her father's estates and worked tirelessly to restore them to their former glory.
Lady Anne was known for her involvement in the War of the Roses and the Civil War, as well as for her marriages to gain titles such as Countess Dowager of Dorset and of Pembroke.
She restored castles such as Brougham, Appleby, Pendragon, and Skipton, as well as several churches.
Lady Anne's legacy includes the Countess Pillar, which she erected to commemorate her mother's passing, and a yearly distribution of money to the poor in the parish.
After her death, Brougham Castle fell into ruin until it was rescued by the Ministry of Works in 1928 and is now under the care of English Heritage.
Lady Anne's impact on the Penrith area is still felt today, with her contributions to the preservation of historical sites and her charitable acts continuing to be remembered and celebrated.

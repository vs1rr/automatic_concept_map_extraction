Brougham Castle, located near Penrith in Westmorland, was originally a Roman fort before being taken over by the Norman family of Vieuxpont to build a stone keep and service buildings.
In 1268, the castle passed to Robert Clifford, who strengthened its defenses during the Scottish wars.
In 1643, Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estate and spent 26 years restoring castles, including Brougham Castle, to their former glory.
She died at Brougham Castle in 1676, after which the castle fell into ruin.
Visitors can explore the impressive ruins, including the oldest part of the castle, the keep, which dates back to around 1175.
The keep features rooms such as the castle's hall, the lord's chamber where Lady Anne slept and died, and a passage on the third floor with views of the surrounding area.
The castle is situated on the banks of the River Eamont, with the River Lowther and A66 nearby.
The site is managed by English Heritage and includes a shop, an exhibition of Roman tombstones, and a guidebook detailing the history of Brougham and Brough Castles.

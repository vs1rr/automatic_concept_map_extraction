Brough Castle, located on the edge of Brough and overlooking the A66, is a historic site dating back to 1090.
Built on the ruins of a Roman fort called Verteris, the castle was initially constructed by William Rufus as a defense against the Scots.
It was later taken by the Scots in 1136 but retaken by the English in 1157.
The castle was besieged by the Scottish king in 1173/4 and surrendered after valiant efforts by its defenders.
Some restoration work was carried out between 1179 and 1190, with major renovations completed in 1203 by Robert de Vipont.
The castle passed into the Clifford family in 1269, who made further additions until it was destroyed by a fire in 1521.
Lady Anne Clifford initiated restoration works in 1661, but the castle fell into disrepair after her death in 1679.
In 1920, the castle was taken over by the Ministry of Works and is now cared for by English Heritage.
Visitors can explore the castle for free, with easy access by road, train, or bus.
Despite facing demolition and neglect over the years, Brough Castle has been preserved as a historic site for visitors to enjoy.

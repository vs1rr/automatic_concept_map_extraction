Brougham Castle, located in Cumbria, was originally a Roman fort before being taken over by the Norman family of Vieuxpont to build their castle.
The current castle was founded by Hugh de Morville in the 12th century.
It fell into decay in the 13th century and was rebuilt in the 16th century by the 2nd Earl of Cumberland.
During the English Civil War, the castle was destroyed by the Parliamentary army.
Lady Anne Clifford inherited the castle in 1643 and spent years restoring it, making it her home until her death in 1676.
After her death, the castle fell into ruin as her grandson used its stones for another castle.
Brougham Castle is now an English Heritage site and is open to visitors from April to September.
The castle overlooks the River Eamont and is considered one of the most impressive castles in Cumbria.
Its history spans from Roman times to the English Civil War, with Lady Anne Clifford playing a significant role in its restoration and preservation.

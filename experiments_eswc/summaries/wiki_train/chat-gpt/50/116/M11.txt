Bramshill House, built in the early 17th century for Lord Zouche, is now a police staff training college.
The Jacobean-style house features symmetrical elevations, a narrow interior court, and a red-tiled roof with large gables and diagonal flues.
The house is made of red brick with stone dressings, including a pierced stone balustrade parapet and elaborate entrance feature.
In 1960, it became the principal police staff training college in the UK, and since 2007 has housed part of the National Policing Improvement Agency.
A refurbishment program is underway and expected to be completed by 2014.

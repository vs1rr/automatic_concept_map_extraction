The Great Staircase at Hatfield House, Hertfordshire.

Date 1611.
â€” The Great Staircase at Hatfield House is a noble feature of the mansion, and is constructed with a degree of magnificence rarely to be met with in domestic architecture.

The height of the staircase is forty feet, and the width twenty feet, the whole being lighted by a lantern at the top.

The balustrade is of stone, and is formed of a series of balusters, with a moulded handrail, the whole being surmounted by a pierced parapet, which adds greatly to the effect of the design.

The staircase is divided into two flights, with a landing at the top, and the walls are adorned with pilasters of the Corinthian order, supporting an entablature, which is enriched with arabesque ornament.

The ceiling of the staircase is also highly decorated, with a series of panels, filled with foliage and fruit, and the whole is executed with great skill and taste.

The staircase at Hatfield House is considered one of the finest examples of its kind in the country, and is a striking illustration of the grandeur and elegance of Elizabethan architecture.

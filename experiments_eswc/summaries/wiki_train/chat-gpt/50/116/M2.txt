Bramshill House is a Jacobean mansion in Hampshire, England, standing on 269 acres of land.
It has been the location of the Police Staff College since 1955.
The history of Bramshill dates back to Saxon times, with Thomas Foxley rebuilding Windsor Castle in the 14th century and constructing a fortified manor house at Bramshill.
Edward Zouche bought the property in 1605 and completed the current house in 1612, including a chapel and priest's hole.
The property changed hands several times, with the Cope family occupying it until 1935.
The chapel was demolished during the 18th century.
After World War II, the exiled King Michael and Queen Ana of Romania lived at Bramshill.
The house also had a cricket ground that hosted four first-class matches in the early 19th century.
Today, a cricket ground still exists on the site of the house.

Bellmans Auctioneers will be selling some of the contents of Bramshill House, the former Police Training College in Hampshire, in May 2015.
The collection, which includes unique and historic pieces, will be auctioned off over four days at Bellmans' West Sussex Saleroom.
Bramshill House, a Grade I listed building, has a rich history and was once home to exiled royalty and a Red Cross Maternity Home during World War Two.
The property was sold to developers in 2014 due to maintenance costs, leading to the auction of its contents.
Notable items up for auction include a massive elm and oak refectory table, oak triple sconce candelabras by Robert 'Mouseman' Thompson, and oak ceremonial armchairs commissioned for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip.
Bellmans Saleroom Manager, Will Pasfield, is excited to oversee the auction process and highlights the unique pieces available, such as the elm topped refectory table.
The auction will be available for viewing in person and online, with online bidding options through the-saleroom.com.
Those interested in participating can contact Bellmans Auctioneers directly for more information and to register their interest.
The auction is set to take place in May, offering buyers the opportunity to own a piece of history from Bramshill House.

Jacobean architecture, prevalent during the reigns of King James I and VI and Charles I in England, was a blend of Flemish, French, and Italian Renaissance influences.
It featured jewelled strapwork, grotesque ornamentation, and a mix of Orders, emblems, and heraldic devices.
Elements of Gothic architecture, such as mullioned windows, were also incorporated.
Notable examples include Hatfield House, Bramshill, and Audley End.
Inigo Jones, known for his Italian style, made contributions during this period but is not considered Jacobean.
A revival of Jacobean architecture occurred in the 19th century, often mixed with the Queen Anne style.
This resulted in unique hybrids like R.

The Los Alamos Historical Society recently hosted a viewing and discussion of the eighth episode of WGN's Manhattan, a series that fictionalizes life in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project.
The episode, titled "The Second Coming," drew a large crowd, including community members and friends.
The Society updates a bulletin board in the Museum each week to explore questions and reactions to the series as it progresses.
Previous episodes are also discussed on the Society's website and Facebook page.


One topic of discussion was the involvement of British scientists in the Manhattan Project.
A group of British scientists, known as the "British Mission," came to Los Alamos to work on the project.
This team, led by Professor James Chadwick, played a crucial role in the success of the Project.
The British Mission provided expertise in implosion, which was essential to the development of the atomic bomb.


Another point of interest was the surveillance of residents by Army intelligence, known as G-2.
Residents coming from Los Alamos were monitored by G-2 agents, who were easily identifiable by their matching three-piece suits and hats.
The episode also explored the reasons why the Thin Man bomb, a gun-type plutonium bomb, was not built.
Experimental discoveries, rather than theoretical predictions, led to the decision not to pursue the Thin Man design.


The episode also delved into the research on implosion bombs and the challenges they presented.
Despite initial doubts about the feasibility of implosion bombs, research on this design continued without interruption.
The episode highlighted the contributions of various scientists, including Seth Neddermeyer, George Kistiakowsky, and John von Neumann, to the development of the implosion bomb.


Additionally, the episode touched on the events in the city of Minsk during World War II.
Minsk, a city in the USSR, was heavily bombed and occupied by the Germans.
It was the site of a large Nazi-run ghetto where tens of thousands of Jews were killed.
The Allies were aware of the Holocaust early on in the war.


Notable references in the episode included Schr√∂dinger's cat, a concept in quantum mechanics, and William Butler Yeats' poem "Second Coming."
The episode also featured a quote from Virginia Woolf about the importance of financial independence and personal space for women.


Overall, the discussion of the eighth episode of Manhattan at the Los Alamos Historical Society provided valuable insights into the historical context and scientific developments of the Manhattan Project.

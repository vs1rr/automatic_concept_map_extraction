Rudolf Ernst Peierls was born in Berlin, Germany on June 5, 1907, to Heinrich Peierls and Elizabeth Weigert.
He was their only child, and although the family was ethnically Jewish, they did not practice the Jewish religion.
Rudolf showed an early interest in science and engineering, but his father, who was the director of a factory, pushed him towards studying physics instead.
Peierls initially wanted to study experimental physics, but due to high demand for practical subjects, he ended up studying mathematics and theoretical physics at Berlin University.


He moved between different universities in Germany, studying under influential physicists such as Arnold Sommerfeld and Werner Heisenberg.
Peierls completed his doctoral dissertation at Leipzig University in 1929 and then worked as an assistant in Zurich.
In 1931, he married Eugenia Nilolaevna Kannegisser, known as Genia, and they had four children together.


During the 1930s, Peierls worked in Rome, England, and Birmingham University, where he held a professorship in mathematical physics.
As the political situation in Germany deteriorated, he sought British citizenship and tried to reject his German citizenship.
When World War II began, Peierls and Otto Frisch informed the British government of the theoretical knowledge needed to create an atomic bomb from uranium-235.
This led to the establishment of the MAUD committee and Peierls' involvement in the British atomic bomb project.


After the war, Peierls worked at Los Alamos and continued his research in Birmingham.
However, his association with Klaus Fuchs, who was later exposed as a Soviet spy, led to suspicions about Peierls' own allegiances.
He faced delays in obtaining a visa to visit the United States and had his security clearance revoked in 1957.
Despite these challenges, Peierls received numerous honors for his scientific contributions, including election to the Royal Society and a Knighthood in 1968.


In 1961, Peierls accepted the Wykeham Chair of Physics at Oxford, where he worked until his retirement in 1974.
He continued to travel and collaborate with other physicists, publishing scientific papers and two books on theoretical physics.
Peierls' work was highly influential, and he was known for his ability to make calculations that deepened the understanding of physical phenomena.


His autobiography, "Bird of Passage," published in 1985, provides insights into his life and career.
Peierls' legacy as a physicist and mathematician is celebrated through his contributions to theoretical physics and his dedication to scientific research.

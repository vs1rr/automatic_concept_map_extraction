In the early stages of World War II, the British Mission was established to explore the potential military applications of uranium fission.
Initially, there was skepticism within official British circles about the significance of uranium fission for military purposes.
However, after the Frisch-Peierls memorandum in March 1940 predicted the feasibility of a uranium bomb, the MAUD Committee was formed to further research and develop this idea.
The British and American nuclear research programs began to cooperate, with the British recognizing the need to rely on American resources for the expensive development work.


By the Spring of 1941, the MAUD Committee was convinced that a bomb was feasible, and progress was made in the separation of uranium-235 and the production of plutonium-239.
The British and American nuclear research programs continued to collaborate, with the Quebec Agreement signed in August 1943 formalizing the terms of cooperation on the bomb project.
British scientists began to work in the United States, contributing to various aspects of the Manhattan Project, including implosion weapon problems and bomb assembly.


The British presence at Los Alamos had a beneficial effect on the morale of the Project, serving as a center of second opinions by respected scientists.
While the United States could have proceeded without British assistance, the collaboration between the two countries on the Manhattan Project was a success.
The British were able to undertake a successful independent nuclear weapons program postwar, thanks in part to the wartime collaboration.


The cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom on nuclear defense has continued over the years, with the 1958 U.S.-U.K. Agreement for Mutual Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes (as Amended) reflecting the ongoing collaboration.
The strengths and weaknesses of the collaboration in the 1940s are still relevant today, with those involved believing that it serves the joint defense interests of both countries.
The story of the choice of the title "MAUD" for the uranium committee, based on a cryptic reference in a telegram from Niels Bohr, adds an interesting historical context to the collaboration.

In 1939, Albert Einstein wrote a letter to President Roosevelt warning about the potential of atomic bombs being developed by the Germans.
Roosevelt, initially hesitant, eventually approved uranium research, leading to the establishment of the Manhattan Project.
The British, lacking resources, deferred to American leadership in the project.
The Germans made little progress in developing atomic weapons, while the Russians and Japanese had limited success.
Ultimately, the Americans were the only ones to successfully develop and use atomic bombs during World War II, gaining a temporary monopoly on the technology.

Mark Oliphant was a physicist born in Australia in 1901, who became a key figure in the development of the atom bomb during World War II.
Despite his initial involvement in the project, Oliphant later became a vocal advocate for the peaceful use of atomic energy and spoke out against the use of nuclear weapons.
He was appalled by the devastation caused by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and dedicated much of his later life to promoting disarmament and opposing nuclear weapons.


Oliphant's interest in science began at a young age, and he pursued a career in physics after being encouraged by a teacher.
He attended the University of Adelaide and later went on to work at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, where he was part of the team that split the first atom in 1932.
He made significant contributions to the understanding of nuclear disintegration and the design of particle accelerators, and his research led to the discovery of helium 3 and tritium.


During World War II, Oliphant played a key role in advocating for the development of an atomic bomb, working with the British Maud Committee and later the Manhattan Project in the United States.
However, after witnessing the destructive power of the bomb, he became a vocal critic of nuclear weapons and joined the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs to promote disarmament.


After the war, Oliphant returned to Australia and became the first director of the Research School of Physical Sciences at the Australian National University.
He also helped establish the Australian Academy of Science and was knighted in 1959 for his contributions to science.
In his later years, he served as the state governor of South Australia and continued to advocate for nuclear disarmament and voluntary euthanasia.


Mark Oliphant passed away in 2000 at the age of 98, leaving behind a legacy as a scientist who played a key role in the development of the atomic bomb but later dedicated his life to promoting peace and opposing nuclear weapons.
His contributions to science and his advocacy for humanitarian causes have left a lasting impact on the scientific community and society as a whole.

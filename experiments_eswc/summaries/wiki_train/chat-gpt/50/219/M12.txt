The Frisch–Peierls memorandum, written in March 1940 by Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, was the first technical exposition of a practical atomic weapon.
It contained new calculations about the critical mass needed for an atomic bomb, specifically 1 kilogram of uranium-235.
This memorandum helped accelerate British and U.S. efforts towards bomb development during World War II.
The document was given to Marcus Oliphant, who passed it on to Henry Tizard, leading to the formation of the secret MAUD Committee.
The memorandum outlined the implications of their calculations and proposed that developing such a weapon before Germany would be the best defense.
The memo also discussed the destructive power of a radioactive "super-bomb," comparing its energy release to that of 1000 tons of dynamite and warning of the dangerous radiations it would produce.
This document played a significant role in shaping Cold War geopolitics and ultimately led to the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The Frisch–Peierls memorandum was a key factor in galvanizing both Britain and America towards the development of atomic weapons, highlighting the destructive power and potential consequences of such technology.

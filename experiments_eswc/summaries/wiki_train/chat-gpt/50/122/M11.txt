Bruce Castle Museum is a Grade I listed 16th century manor house with a rich history.
Built by William Compton, a member of Henry VIII's court, the building has been modified by various owners over the years.
The building is said to be haunted by the wife of the 2nd Lord Coleraine.
Sir Rowland Hill's family ran a school for boys at Bruce Castle during the Victorian era.
The museum opened in 1906 and now houses the Borough of Haring

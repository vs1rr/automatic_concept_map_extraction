Bruce Castle Museum in Tottenham is a valuable resource for Family History and Local History projects, housing archives for the Borough of Haringey including maps, census returns, newspapers, and historical photographs.
The museum, located in a 16th Century manor house, offers exhibitions, workshops, and a park for visitors to enjoy.
The house has a rich history, with connections to Henry VIII's court and the Coleraine family.
Sir Rowland Hill's family ran a school at Bruce Castle during the Victorian period, and the museum opened in 1906 to showcase the local history collections.
The Friends of Bruce Castle and Haringey Local History Forum support the museum's work, although the latter has been disbanded.
Some of its functions have been taken over by the Tottenham Civic Society, which aims to educate the public about the history and architecture of Tottenham.
The society also works to preserve and protect features of historic and environmental interest in the area.
The museum staff have been instrumental in helping develop the 'Summerhill Road' website, providing valuable information about the area.
Those interested in joining any of these groups can contact the respective membership secretaries.
To stay updated on museum events, individuals can contact the Curator to be added to the mailing list.

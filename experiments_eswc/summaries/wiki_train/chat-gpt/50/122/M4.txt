Bruce Castle Museum in London is a Grade I listed 16th-century manor house located in 20 acres of parkland.
The museum features exhibitions on a variety of topics, including the history of Haringey and Tottenham, local sport, the history of the house, and the growth of Tottenham.
One of the most interesting exhibits focuses on the Broadwater Farm Estate and its development following the 1980s riots.
The museum is described as having a small-town feel and is in need of some maintenance, but it offers a unique look into the history and heritage of the area.
Visitors can also enjoy the surrounding park, workshops, events, tours, and talks about local history.
Entry to the museum is free, making it a great place for a family day out.
Despite some areas needing improvement, the museum is praised for its interesting exhibits and historical significance.

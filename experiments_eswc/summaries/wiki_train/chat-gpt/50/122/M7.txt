Bruce Castle Museum, Archives, and Park in Tottenham is supported by the Friends of Bruce Castle.
The Grade 1 listed building has a rich history dating back to the 16th century when it was owned by Sir William Compton.
Over the years, the building was modified by various owners, including Lord Coleraine and Rowland Hill, who opened a school for boys on the site in 1827.
The park, which was almost built over after the school closed in 1891, was saved by philanthropist Joshua Pedley.
The building opened as a museum in 1906 and now houses collections covering the history of the London Borough of Haringey, as well as the borough's archives.
The park, Haringey's oldest, has been enjoyed by generations of residents for activities such as bowls, tennis, and funfairs.
Despite the loss of many stately trees, the park still boasts the Great Oak, estimated to be 450-500 years old.
The museum offers a schools programme, family activities, exhibitions, and local history talks.

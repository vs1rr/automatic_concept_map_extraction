Bruce Castle, also known as Lordship House, is a manor house located in Tottenham, London.
Despite its grand name, it has a history filled with questions and mysteries.
The house was originally named Lordship House and was later renamed Bruce Castle by its owner, Henry Hare, Baron Coleraine.
The Tudor Tower, a notable structure on the grounds, is believed to have been a dovecote.
The house itself has undergone numerous remodelings over the years, with different owners adding wings and changing facades.
The core of the present building is thought to have been built during the time of Henry VIII.
The house changed hands frequently, with one owner, Hugh Hare, renaming it Bruce Castle as part of his social ascent.
Hugh Hare's connections at court and support of the king led to his downfall during the Civil War, but his properties were returned to him after the Restoration.
The house later became a school under headmaster Sir Rowland Hill, who introduced the world's first postage stamp.
The school was known for its progressive curriculum and teaching methods.
After the school closed, the house was acquired by the local council and opened to the public as a museum in 1906.
The house is said to be haunted by the ghost of Constantia Lucy, who committed suicide after her close connection with Henry Hare led to his marriage to another woman.
Despite its historical significance and resident ghost, Bruce Castle remains a place of mystery and intrigue, with its past filled with tales of social climbing, political turmoil, and educational innovation.

Bruce Castle is a 16th century manor house in Tottenham with a rich history.
Originally known as 'Lordship House', the site has been occupied since the early medieval period.
In 1254, part of the land belonged to the 'de Bruce' family of Scotland, but was later taken back by the English crown when Robert the Bruce became king of Scotland.
By 1514, the site was owned by William Compton, a close friend of Henry VIII.
The Round Tower was built during this time, possibly for falconry.
In 1516, Henry VIII borrowed the manor house to meet his sister, Queen Margaret of Scotland.
The house was also used as a refuge from the Plague in the late 1500s.
In 1626, the house and land was owned by Hugh Hare, 1st Lord Coleraine, who died in 1667 after choking on a turkey bone.
His grandson, Henry Hare, 2nd Lord Coleraine, inherited the house and had a mysterious relationship with his wife Constantia Lucy, who is said to have jumped to her death from the balcony with her child.
Henry Hare remodeled the house between 1682 and 1684, giving it the name 'Bruce Castle'.
The house passed through several owners, including James Townsend and John Eardley Wilmot, before being purchased by the Hill family who opened a private boarding school for boys.
The school was popular and attracted students from around the world, including visits from Charles Dickens and Charles Babbage.
The school closed in 1891, and the building became Tottenham's first public museum in 1906.
During World War II, the museum was used as a clinic and for exhibitions about the war effort.
Today, Bruce Castle is a Grade 1 listed building housing the London Borough of Haringey's archive and local history museum.

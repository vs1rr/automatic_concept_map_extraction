Bruce Castle Park in Haringey is located on the site of one of the four manors of Tottenham, with the only remaining mansion in the area.
The park is named after its connection to the Scottish royal family of de Brus.
The present house was likely built in the 1620s, with the park opening in 1892 as Tottenham's first public park.
The park features many trees dating back to the 19th century, including an ancient oak over 400 years old.
Bruce Castle became a museum in 1906, housing the local history collection.
The park has various facilities such as football, tennis, and a playground, and hosts events like the Tottenham Community Festival and Bruce Castle Carnival.
The park has won a Green Flag Award for several consecutive years.
The park's history includes illustrious owners over the centuries, with the house being used as a pioneering school from 1827 to 1891.
The park's layout has remained largely unchanged since the 19th century, with features such as a circular flower garden and a paddling pool.
The park is surrounded by residential streets and the Church of All Hallows, with public transport options available for access.

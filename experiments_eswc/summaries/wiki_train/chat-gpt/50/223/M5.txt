Constantine the Great, who ruled from 306-337 C.E., played a significant role in the fall of the Roman Empire.
He divided the empire into two parts and made Christianity the dominant religion, which went against the traditional Roman polytheistic beliefs.
The Visigoths, led by Alaric, breached the walls of Rome in 410 C.E., looting and pillaging the city for three days.
This marked the first time Rome was sacked, but not the last.
Constantine's decision to split the empire into western and eastern halves further weakened the empire.
The eastern half, centered in Constantinople, thrived while the western half declined.
The fall of the western half of the Roman Empire was also influenced by economic issues, such as a decrease in agricultural production, trade deficits, inflation, and disruptions in trade due to piracy and attacks from Germanic tribes.
Political and military problems, including corruption, a mercenary army, and the hiring of unreliable Germanic soldiers, also contributed to the fall.
The Germanic tribes, including the Visigoths, Vandals, Angles, Saxons, Franks, Ostrogoths, and Lombards, played a significant role in the fall of the Roman Empire as they invaded and settled in various regions, ultimately overthrowing the last Roman emperor in the west in 476 C.E.
The fall of Rome marked the end of the order that the empire had brought to western Europe for a millennium.

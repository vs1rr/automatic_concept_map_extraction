On May 29th, 1453, Constantinople fell to Ottoman forces after a 40-day siege, marking a significant moment in warfare history.
The use of gunpowder proved that even the strongest walls could be breached, ending the era of immobile soldiers defending stone fortresses.
The fall of Constantinople had religious implications as well, with portents leading up to the final assault.
The city's defenders, including the Byzantines and their allies, faced a brutal attack that resulted in the massacre of worshippers and priests at Saint Sophia.
Sultan Mehmet, the conqueror, preserved some religious sites and institutions, including the Greek Orthodox patriarchate.
The fall of Constantinople had far-reaching consequences, including the preservation of eastern Christendom's doctrinal integrity and the shift of political power to Russia.
The fall also accelerated trends such as the decline of the Byzantine Empire, the flight of Greek scholars to Italy, and the ongoing conflict between the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires.
The Ottoman Empire continued to expand its territories in southeastern Europe until the early 20th century, leaving behind Muslim pockets in countries like Albania and Bosnia.
The enmities between Turkey and Greece persisted, with conflicts such as the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974.
The historical events of 1453 continue to impact modern-day relations, with Turkey's EU membership bid facing obstacles rooted in centuries-old animosities.

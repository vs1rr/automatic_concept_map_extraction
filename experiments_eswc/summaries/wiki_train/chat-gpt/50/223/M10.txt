Justinian I, born around 482 CE in Illyria, was one of the most important late Roman and Byzantine emperors.
He reigned from 527 to 565 CE and is known for his military campaigns to retake Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Goths.
He also ordered the rebuilding of the Hagia Sophia church and completed the Codex Iustinianus, which brought together all Roman laws issued from Emperor Hadrian to the present.
Justinian's early life is not well-documented, but he was raised by his uncle Emperor Justin I and married Theodora, a woman from a poor background.
He initiated military campaigns in the east before focusing on Africa and Italy.
The Vandals were defeated in 534 CE, and the Goths in Italy were eventually conquered by 540 CE, although the Gothic War continued with the rise of Totila.
Justinian's reign was marked by civil unrest, including the Nika riots in 532 CE and Samaritan revolts.
He commissioned the Codex Iustinianus to compile Roman laws and his life was recorded by Procopius in works that both praised and criticized his rule.
Justinian's achievements in art, architecture, legal reform, and conquest have solidified his legacy as one of the greatest emperors in late Roman and Byzantine history.
His Christian faith influenced his rule and marked a transition of emperors as leaders of faith and patronage.

The Byzantine Empire, originating in 330 A.D. when Roman Emperor Constantine I established a new capital in Byzantium, survived for 1,000 years after the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476.
The empire served as a military buffer between Europe and Asia, and was known for its rich tradition of art, literature, and learning.
The citizens of Constantinople identified strongly as Romans and Christians, though Greek was widely spoken.
The empire was able to survive due to its geographic location, strong administrative center, internal political stability, and economic resources.
Under Emperor Justinian I, the empire reached its peak, but faced financial struggles and threats from external forces.
The empire faced attacks from Persians, Slavs, and Muslims, losing territories in the process.
The Byzantine Empire experienced a period of Iconoclasm, denying the holiness of religious images, before entering a golden age under the Macedonian dynasty.
The empire enjoyed a flourishing culture of monasticism and missionary work.
The Crusades brought conflict between Byzantium and the West, culminating in the conquest and looting of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204.
The empire fell in 1453 when the Ottoman army stormed Constantinople.
Despite its fall, Byzantine culture continued to influence the Western intellectual tradition and countries practicing its Orthodox religion.

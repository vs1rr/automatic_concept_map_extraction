The text discusses the Imperial Recovery under the Macedonian Dynasty in the Byzantine Empire, which began in 867 CE.
The dynasty oversaw a period known as the Byzantine Renaissance, characterized by cultural and artistic flourishing.
The empire expanded its territories, conquering Crete, Cyprus, and most of Syria.
However, there was also instability due to competition among nobles in the theme system, which weakened the authority of the emperors.
The period saw significant religious events, such as the conversion of the Bulgarians, Serbs, and Rus' to Orthodox Christianity.
The Byzantine scholars and artists of the time drew inspiration from the classical Greco-Roman heritage, leading to a revival of art and literature.
The Macedonian Dynasty also had military successes, with Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas leading conquests in Crete, Cyprus, and Syria.
The conversion of the Slavs to Christianity by Cyril and Methodius, who also created the Glagolitic alphabet, was another significant event.
However, the competition among nobles for land in the theme system led to dissatisfaction among small farmers, as governors increased taxes for personal gain.
This period of Byzantine history had a lasting impact on European religious and cultural developments, with influences on later Italian Renaissance painters.

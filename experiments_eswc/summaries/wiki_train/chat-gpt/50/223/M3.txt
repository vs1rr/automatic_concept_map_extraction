The Byzantine Empire, also known as Byzantium or the Eastern Roman Empire, was the direct continuation of the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, centered on the capital of Constantinople.
The empire reached its height under the Macedonian emperors of the late 9th, 10th, and early 11th centuries, gaining control over various territories and defeating the Bulgarians.
One of its greatest achievements was the codification of Roman law during the reign of Justinian, resulting in the Corpus Juris Civilis.
Byzantine art was primarily created for spiritual purposes, with examples showcasing the culture's splendor and spirituality.
The empire's economic expansion was driven by the demands of the imperial court and administrative hierarchies.
Despite emphasizing their Roman origins, Byzantine culture and language were influenced by Hellenization and theocracy over time.
The Byzantines saw themselves as heirs of an ancient past and played a key role in passing on classical and Near Eastern culture to Renaissance Italy and early modern Europe.
The empire lasted for over a thousand years, from its founding by Constantine the Great in 330 to its fall in 1453 to the Ottoman Empire under Mehmet II.
The Byzantine Empire's longevity and achievements in Roman law, preservation of Greek texts, and spread of Christianity set it apart from the disintegration and conquests that characterized Western Europe during the same period.

The period from 500AD to 1000AD in the Balkans was marked by constant warfare and invasions from various barbarian tribes.
The Byzantine Empire, which dominated the region, faced threats from the Bulgars, Slavs, Avars, and Magyars.
The Slavs, initially small raiding groups, eventually settled in the Balkans and formed tribes led by chieftains.
The Bulgars, Asiatic horsemen related to the Huns, had a strong cavalry element and were subjects of the Avars before establishing their own kingdom.
The Avars, heavy bow-armed cavalry, allied with the Slavs and Bulgars to ravage the Balkans but were eventually defeated by the Byzantines.
The Byzantine Empire, under Justinian, reached its greatest extent but spent much of the 7th century on the defensive against Arab and Sassanid invasions.
The Byzantine military organization and tactics were based on defensive infantry lines and heavy cavalry.
The Slavs, Croats, and Serbs established themselves as semi-independent tribes, throwing off Avar control and engaging in intermittent wars with the Byzantines.
The Franks assisted in destroying the Avars by the end of the 8th century.
The Bulgars, under various rulers, engaged in wars with the Byzantines, expanding their territory at times but ultimately declining.
The Magyars, mounted archers, settled in Hungary and invaded various European territories until their defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.
The Serbs and Croats also established themselves as independent states, facing invasions and conflicts with neighboring powers.
The Dark Ages in the Balkans were characterized by constant warfare and invasions, leading to the establishment of various states and the dominance of the Byzantine Empire in the region.

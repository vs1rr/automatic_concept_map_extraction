The Battle of Manzikert in 1071 between the Byzantine Empire and Seljuk Turkish forces led by Alp Arslan resulted in the defeat of the Byzantine Empire and the capture of Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes.
Prior to the battle, the Seljuks had been causing trouble in Armenia and Asia Minor, sacking cities and plundering farmland.
Romanus led two expeditions against them, but his slow-moving infantry could not catch the speedy Turkish cavalry.
In 1070, Romanus led a second expedition towards Manzikert, offering a treaty to Alp Arslan, which was declined.
The Byzantine army, consisting of troops from various provinces and mercenaries, marched across Asia Minor to confront the Seljuks.
The Seljuks, led by Alp Arslan, were organized into a crescent formation and attacked the Byzantines with archers.
The Byzantines, confused and betrayed by some of their own generals, were eventually defeated, with Romanus being injured and taken prisoner.
Despite relatively low casualties, the defeat at Manzikert was seen as a disaster for the Byzantine Empire, leading to political destabilization and the eventual loss of Asia Minor to the Seljuks.
The battle is considered a root cause for the later Crusades, as it signaled the decline of Byzantine power in the region.

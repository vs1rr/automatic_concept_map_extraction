The Roman province of Egypt, known as Aegyptus, was established in 30 BC under the reign of Augustus after his victory over Mark Anthony and Queen Cleopatra.
The capital of Egypt was Alexandria, and the province was named after an ancient Greek ruler named Aegyptus.
The first governor of Egypt was Gaius Cornelius Gallus, who brought an end to political influence in the region.
The governor was in charge of administration, justice, and military security, with the help of legions and cohorts.
Egypt was divided into small provinces with town councils for smooth administration.
The Romans derived significant revenue from Egypt through a complex tax system, including taxes on land and poll taxes.
The social hierarchy introduced by the Romans placed Romans and Greeks at the top, followed by metropolites and villagers.
Egypt was an essential source of food for the Romans, with goods being exchanged for coins during trading activities.
Christianity spread throughout Egypt, with Alexandria becoming a major center for the religion.
The Roman province also supported principles like Arianism, Gnosticism, Manichaeism, and Monasticism.
After the partition of the Roman Empire, Egypt became part of the Byzantine Empire, with Greek remaining the popular language and Alexandria remaining a religious and economic center.
The province faced economic decline due to excessive taxation in the 3rd century, leading to a revolt by the Egyptians.
Overall, the Roman province of Egypt played a significant role in Roman governance, trade, and the spread of Christianity in the region.

Ancient Egypt was a civilization located in Northern Africa, centered around the Nile River.
The Nile, the longest river in the world, flowed from central Africa to the Mediterranean Sea, providing fertile soil for farming in the "Black land" along its banks.
The harsh deserts beyond this area were known as the "Red lands."
Egypt's natural boundaries, including deserts, seas, and cataracts on the Nile, helped protect it from invasion, contributing to over 3000 years of prosperity.


Ancient Egyptians were polytheistic, worshipping many gods associated with natural forces and heavenly bodies.
The sun and land gods were particularly important due to Egypt's reliance on the sun and river lands.
The story of Osiris, who was murdered by his brother Seth and resurrected by his wife Isis, was symbolic for resurrection and new life.
The mummification process, which involved preserving the dead for their future rebirth, included washing the body with Nile water, removing organs, and wrapping the body in linen soaked in resin.


Pyramids, primarily built during the Old Kingdom, were part of large complexes dedicated to the dead.
These complexes included pyramids for the pharaoh, smaller pyramids for his family, and mastabas for officials.
Inside pyramids, archaeologists found supplies for the pharaoh's resurrection, such as food, furniture, and jewels.
The timeline of Ancient Egypt includes periods like the Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and New Kingdom, each marked by different characteristics and events.


The first king of Egypt, possibly Aha or Menes, united Upper and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom around 3100 BCE.
Pharaohs in the Old Kingdom were seen as divine and possessed absolute power, leading to an age of prosperity and splendor.
The Middle Kingdom, considered a "golden age," saw stability, expanded trade, and military expansion.
The New Kingdom, the most powerful state in Southwest Asia, included pharaohs like Amenhotep IV, who tried to change the religion to focus on the god Aton.

Egyptian society had a simple structure, organized like a pyramid with the pharaoh at the top and slaves and servants at the bottom.
Marriage was arranged for young girls and boys, with wives respected and in charge of the household.
Women could own property and inherit, but most bureaucratic careers were closed to them.
The Egyptians invented hieroglyphics, a complex writing system using pictures and abstract forms, as well as a simplified version called hieratic script for business transactions.


In addition to their advancements in writing, the Egyptians made contributions to mathematics, including a 365-day calendar.
They also developed technologies in areas like agriculture, literature, and water clocks.
Their art, including sculptures, jewelry, and ceramics, had a distinctive style that was easily recognizable as Egyptian.
Ancient Egypt's legacy includes its rich history, culture, and technological achievements that continue to fascinate and inspire people today.

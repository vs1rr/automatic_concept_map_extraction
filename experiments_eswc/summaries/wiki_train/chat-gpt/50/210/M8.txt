Ancient Egypt, spanning the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, has had a profound influence on Western traditions in art, architecture, and religion.
The Old Kingdom, beginning in 2700 B.C., saw the construction of the Step Pyramid by Pharaoh Zoser, marking a shift towards pyramid building for the afterlife.
The religion of the time focused on creation and a pantheon of gods, with the decline of the Old Kingdom attributed to shifts in power and the depletion of resources.
The Middle Kingdom, from 2050 B.C., saw a resurgence in pyramid building and the rise of the god Osiris, whose myth bears similarities to Christian beliefs.
The Middle Kingdom also saw advancements in art and literature.
The New Kingdom, from 1465 B.C., saw the Valley of the Kings replace pyramids as burial grounds, and a shift towards monotheism under Pharaoh Akhenaton.
Despite internal struggles, ancient Egypt's legacy lives on in Western culture.

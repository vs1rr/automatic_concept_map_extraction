The Ramesside Period, during the 19th and 20th Dynasties, was a time of prosperity in ancient Egypt.
The succession of kings from one family provided stability and benefited the land.
There was a push to redefine the country under the Amen cult, leading to the destruction of statues from the Amarna Period.
This reformation aimed to unify the faith of the people.
The kings of this period also made extensions to royal tombs, such as Rameses II adding a forecourt and shrine to Amenhotep III's tomb.
The tombs of the royal family became elaborate and decorated with religious texts to aid the deceased pharaohs in the afterlife.
Queens, like Nefertari, were also given elaborate tombs with religious texts.
Family was important during this time, as seen in the close kinship between Sety I and Rameses II, and Rameses II's construction of a large tomb for his sons.
The workers at Deir el-Medina documented their activities and thoughts on ostraca, showing the value placed on family and life on earth during the Ramesside Period.
Overall, this period was characterized by prosperity, religious reformation, elaborate royal tombs, and a strong emphasis on family

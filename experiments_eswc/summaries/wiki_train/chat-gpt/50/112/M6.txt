It is written on vellum in a script known as "insular majuscule" and contains 340 folios that were trimmed and gilded in the 19th century.
The dimensions of the book are approximately 33 x 25 cm.
The Book of Kells is a significant work of Celtic and medieval illumination, with intricate decorations and ornamentation.
The images of the manuscript are available for single-use academic purposes only, and publication or display requires written approval from Trinity College Library, Dublin.

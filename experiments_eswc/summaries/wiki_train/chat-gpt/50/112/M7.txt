The Book of Kells is a religious manuscript containing the four gospels, but it is also considered a masterpiece of Celtic art and a treasure of Western Europe.
It was possibly begun on the Isle of Iona and later moved to Kells Monastery in Ireland for protection.
Stolen in 1007, it was recovered with some water damage and lost its golden cover.
The book remained at Kells until 1541 when it was taken by the Roman Catholic Church for protection, eventually returning to Trinity College of Dublin in 1661.
Approximately 30 pages have been lost over the years, but the remaining 340 pages showcase intricate artwork done by hand over thirty years.
The artwork covers a variety of styles and depicts events in the life of Christ with amazing detail.
Each page is unique, with no symbols duplicated elsewhere in the book.
The level of detail in the Book of Kells is so precise that it was believed only angels could have created it.
Today, the book remains at Trinity College and is considered the most important work in the university library.
Its artwork and design provide a glimpse into ancient Ireland and the skill of its illustrators, making it a true masterpiece of Celtic art.

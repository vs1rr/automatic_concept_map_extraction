The article discusses the idea that seventh- and eighth-century illuminators of Insular manuscripts may have had knowledge of stereoscopic images, allowing them to create intricate and detailed designs.
The close repetition of interlace patterns in these manuscripts suggests the use of stereoscopic imagery, with spacings between repetitions aligning with interpupillary distances.
The illuminators likely used their eyes as a camera lucida to copy designs and then as a stereocomparator to minimize disparities between repetitions.
The paper argues that this technique was known long before the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and was used by particularly gifted artists in the early medieval British Isles to create detailed manuscripts like the Book of Durrow, Lindisfarne Gospels, and Book of Kells.
These artists may have used free-fusion stereocomparison to achieve the magnification needed to work in microscopic detail.
The article suggests that this technique was only used for specific repeating patterns in Insular illumination and that the high quality of these manuscripts indicates the use of this method.
Overall, the paper proposes that stereoscopic imagery was a long-lost secret of medieval illuminators, allowing them to create detailed and intricate designs in manuscripts centuries before the invention of magnifying lenses.

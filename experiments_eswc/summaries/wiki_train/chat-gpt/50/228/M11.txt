San Felipe de Austin was founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin as the unofficial capital of his colony.
It quickly became the first urban center in the Austin colony, serving as a social, economic, and political hub.
The town's population grew steadily, reaching about 600 by the eve of the Texas Revolution.
San Felipe de Austin was also a key location for the Texas postal service and the publishing of newspapers, including the Texas Gazette and Gail Borden's Telegraph and Texas Register.


Many significant figures in early Texas history resided in or visited San Felipe de Austin, including Josiah H. Bell, James B. Miller, Noah Smithwick, and Horatio Chriesman.
The town also became a trading center for cotton plantations established in the surrounding area.
As the capital of the colony, San Felipe de Austin played a crucial role in the events leading up to the Texas Revolution, hosting conventions and serving as the provisional government's capital.


During the Texas Revolution, San Felipe de Austin was burned to the ground by its own garrison to prevent it from falling into the hands of the advancing Mexican army.
The residents fled eastward during the Runaway Scrape, but many returned after news of the Texans' victory at the Battle of San Jacinto.
However, the town never fully recovered its former stature, and administrative functions were eventually moved to Bellville in 1848.


In 1940, most of the original townsite property was donated to the state.
The town's history is commemorated annually, and notable events such as the burning of the colonial capital and the brief battle across the Brazos River are remembered.

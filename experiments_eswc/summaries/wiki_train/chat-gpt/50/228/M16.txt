San Felipe de Austin, located near present-day Houston, was founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin and served as the unofficial capital of his colony.
It became the first urban center in the Austin colony and played a significant role in the Texas Revolution.
The town was home to Texas' first English language newspaper, the Texas Gazette, and saw the beginning of the Texas Rangers.
San Felipe hosted important conventions and meetings that led to the Texas Declaration of Independence.
In 1836, the town was burned by Santa Anna's invading Mexican army but was later restored after Texas' victory at San Jacinto.
The town's population fluctuated over the years, with an influx of Germans, freedmen, Czechs, and Mexican immigrants.
San Felipe declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with many residents moving to nearby towns like Sealy.
The original town site now lies within the Stephen F. Austin State Historical Park, which features monuments and a replica of Austin's log house.
The town's history is preserved through various historical markers and museums, showcasing its importance in early Texas history.

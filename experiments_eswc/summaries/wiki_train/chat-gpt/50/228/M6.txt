San Felipe de Austin was the colonial capital of the Anglo colonies in Mexican Texas during the 1820s.
Conventions were held in 1832 and 1833 to address grievances and propose changes to the Mexican government.
Stephen F. Austin was elected president of the Convention of 1832, where delegates requested modifications to the Law of April 6, 1830 and proposed separate statehood from Coahuila.
However, these resolutions were never presented to the Mexican government.
Another convention in 1833 petitioned for the repeal of anti-immigration laws and passed resolutions against African slave traffic.
Austin's imprisonment in Mexico from 1834 to 1835 further fueled the movement for an independent Texas.
The convention in San Felipe in November 1835 decided against declaring independence, but passed a "solemn declaration" outlining grievances and established a provisional state government.
The government of Texas ruled from San Felipe for five months during the Texas Revolution.
While the Declaration of Independence was adopted in Washington-on-the-Brazos, the events leading to independence were centered around Stephen F. Austin's headquarters in San Felipe de Austin.

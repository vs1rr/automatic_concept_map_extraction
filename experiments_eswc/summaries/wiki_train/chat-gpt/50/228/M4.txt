The Convention of 1833 met in San Felipe as a successor to the Convention of 1832, with approximately fifty-six delegates attending, including Sam Houston.
The convention petitioned for the repeal of the anti-immigration section of the Law of April 6, 1830, and passed resolutions prohibiting African slave traffic into Texas.
Delegates also proposed splitting Coahuila and Texas and prepared a constitution for submission to the Mexican Congress, modeled after the Massachusetts constitution of 1780.
David G. Burnet was chosen to head a committee to prepare a memorial to the Mexican government, and Juan Erasmo Segu√≠n, Dr. James B. Miller, and Stephen F. Austin were chosen to present the petitions.
Austin ended up going to Mexico alone.
The convention adjourned on April 13.
The proceedings of the Convention of 1833 were documented in various sources, including Stephen F. Austin's explanation to the public, Eugene C. Barker's The Life of Stephen F. Austin, and the Austin Papers.
Other sources include Holland Edwards Bell's thesis on the Texas Convention of 1832, John Henry Brown's History of Texas, E. W. Winkler's article on the membership of the convention, and Henderson K. Yoakum's History of Texas.

In the early 19th century, Mexico's migration policy for Texas was similar to that for California and New Mexico.
A US citizen from Arkansas, Moses Austin, had acquired land in Texas in 1820, which was confirmed by Mexico in 1823.
Austin's son, Stephen F. Austin, began selling plots of land to settlers, attracting people from various states with the promise of fertile land for farming at a low cost.
However, Mexico imposed restrictions on land ownership by foreigners, leading to tensions with the Anglo settlers in Texas.


President Andrew Jackson's offer to buy Texas was rejected by Mexico in 1828.
The Anglo-American migrants in Texas were industrious and educated, setting up schools and demonstrating their ability to succeed as farmers.
Mexico's elite had no interest in moving to Texas, while the poor saw limited opportunities for success.
Concerned about immigrants taking over Texas, Mexico considered settling convicts or inviting Catholic migrants from Europe.


In 1829, President Guerrero abolished slavery in Mexico's territories to discourage Yankee migration.
Mexico passed laws prohibiting foreigners from settling without a passport and began encouraging Mexicans and European migrants to settle in Texas, upsetting the Anglos who wanted to preserve their culture and political rights, including the demand for slavery.


Political turmoil in Mexico led to President Bustamante's unpopularity, with Santa Anna leading an uprising against him in 1832.
Santa Anna won the presidency in a landslide, with liberal Valentín Gómez Farías as vice president.
Santa Anna's reforms, including reducing the army size and secularizing education, alienated conservatives.
The Anglos in Texas held a convention in 1833, calling for reforms and autonomy within Mexico.


In 1833, Mexico's military rebelled against Gómez Farías, declaring Santa Anna dictator.
Santa Anna repealed the constitution of 1824 and sent Gómez Farías into exile.
Santa Anna's military attacks and intimidation tactics led to unrest in Texas, with Anglo-Americans defying him and voting to defend the constitution.
Santa Anna sent General Cós to disarm settlers, leading to fighting and the creation of a provisional government in Texas.


In December 1835, the Battle of the Alamo took place, with Santa Anna defeating the Anglo defenders.
Santa Anna's subsequent actions, including executing captured Anglos, led to the Texas Declaration of Independence in March 1836.
Santa Anna's defeat at the Battle of San Jacinto by Sam Houston's forces resulted in his capture and a pledge to end the fighting and withdraw Mexican troops from Texas.


In November 1836, Texas was officially recognized as independent by the United States, but Mexico refused to recognize its independence.
France, Great Britain, Holland, and Belgium established trade agreements with Texas and recognized its independence in the following years.
Santa Anna's failed attempt to sell Texas to the United States led to his return to Mexico, where he faced opposition and continued political turmoil.


Overall, the text highlights the complex relationship between Mexico, the US, and Texas during the early 19th century, marked by migration, land disputes, political unrest, and the struggle for independence.

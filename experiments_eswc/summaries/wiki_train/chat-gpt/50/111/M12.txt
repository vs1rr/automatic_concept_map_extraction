Bodiam Castle, located in East Sussex, England, was built in 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge as a fortress to defend against potential French invasion during the Hundred Years' War.
The castle was built quickly in one phase and became the center of the manor of Bodiam.
It passed through several generations of the Dalyngrigge family before being acquired by the Lewknors in the 15th century.
The castle changed hands multiple times over the centuries, eventually falling into disrepair and being purchased by John 'Mad Jack' Fuller in 1829.
Fuller began restoration work on the castle, which was continued by subsequent owners.
In 1916, Lord Curzon purchased the land and began a systematic restoration of the castle, which was eventually given to the National Trust in 1925.
Bodiam Castle is now a Scheduled Monument and Grade I listed building, open to the public and often used as a filming location.
The castle features a wide moat, sweeping battlements, spiral staircases, and a gatehouse with an original wooden portcullis.
The castle's layout includes various chambers built around the outer defensive walls, with water supplied to the moat by several springs.
The castle has multiple entrances, including a drawbridge and a long straight bridge.
Bodiam Castle is known for its narrow and steep staircases, which would have been challenging for inhabitants and visitors in medieval times.
The castle is also said to be haunted, with reports of ghostly sightings and sounds.

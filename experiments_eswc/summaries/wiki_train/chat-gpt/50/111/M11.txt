Bodiam Castle, with its impressive towers and broad moat, is often likened to a giant sandcastle.
Built during a time when the Nobility sought more comfortable and secure living spaces that also showcased their wealth, Bodiam is more accurately described as a Courtyard Castle.
Constructed during the Hundred Years War, the castle's builder, Sir Edward Dalyngrigge, gained wealth and reputation through his military exploits.
The castle remained in the Dalyngrigge family until 1483 when it passed to the Lewknors.
Throughout history, the castle changed hands several times, eventually falling into disrepair until it was rescued by John 'Mad Jack' Fuller in 1815.
The castle was later sold to Lord Ashcombe, who undertook vital repairs.
In 1916, Lord Curzon purchased the castle and embarked on a restoration project, eventually leaving it to The National Trust.
Today, Bodiam Castle is open to visitors and offers a glimpse into medieval history.
The castle's exterior remains well-preserved, while the interior may disappoint some visitors.
Despite this, Bodiam Castle is a popular destination for families and history enthusiasts alike.

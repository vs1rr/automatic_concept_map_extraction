Friends of Bruce Castle The support group for Bruce Castle Museum, Archives and Park The Museum and its associated Round Tower is Tottenham's only Grade 1 listed building.
The building opened as a museum in 1906, and its present collections cover the history of the areas which make up the London Borough of Haringey.
There is more information about the building and its occupants in Bruce Castle's Wikipedia entry, while Mysterious Britain and Ireland has a short article on the ghosts that are alleged to haunt the building.

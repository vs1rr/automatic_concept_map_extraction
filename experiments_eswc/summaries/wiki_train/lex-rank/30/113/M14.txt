Borobudur is a Buddhist stupa and temple complex in Central Java, Indonesia dating from the 8th century, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
This is one of world's truly great ancient monuments, the single largest Buddhist structure anywhere on earth, and few who visit fail to be taken by both the scale of place, and the remarkable attention to detail that went into the construction.
It was likely founded as a religious site in the 8th century at the peak of the Sailendra dynasty in central Java.
The construction is thought to have taken a period of 75 years, and completed in about 825 AD.
Borobudur and the nearby Hindu Prambanan temple complex were more or less contemporaneous.
It took two months to clear the jungle and partially reveal the amazing monument, but it was not until 1885 that the complex was unearthed in its magnificent entirety.
Modern day Borobudur In 1956 UNESCO began an assessment process for the full scale restoration of the monument.
As well as being the single most popular tourist attraction in modern day Indonesia, Borobudur has resumed its role as an important place of worship and pilgrimage for Indonesian Buddhists.
The temple complex was closed from 5–9 November 2010 to clean up that ash-fall, and the upper levels remained closed to the public until late September 2011.
Borobudur is not only a favorite of foreign tourists, but also domestic tourists, mainly students of all ages, usually in May and June.
If you are planning a visit, try not to visit during school holiday season, it is worth investigating those dates.
Both are well connected domestically, and also offer some international connections to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.
By bus[edit]The public buses to Borobudur from Yogyakarta are aimed mostly at Indonesian visitors, and only a few tourists venture aboard.
If you are adventurous though, the Trans-Jogya service runs from central Yogyakarta to Jombor bus terminal in northern Yogyakarta, bus 2B/2A (Rp 3,000), where you can change to another bus to get to Borobudur.
It takes about 60–90 minutes, and should cost around Rp 10,000-20,000 one way.
If you are a tourist, the bus conductor may try to charge you more than the local rate, so if you are on a very tight budget you can negotiate a little for a better price.
To get from or to the Hindu temples at Prambanan, take a Yogyakarta bus and get down at Jombor Terminal (90 min, Rp 15,000 for foreigners, Rp 7,000 for Indonesians).
A taxi from central Yogyakarta to Borobudur costs around Rp 200,000, and from Yogyakarta airport about Rp 225,000.

If you want to truly understand the reliefs, it is best to employ a guide to explain the stories to you.
These are mostly hidden by the post-original construction masking at the foot of the monument.
The masking was disassembled in 1890 before being painstakingly rebuilt, and photographs were taken of the reliefs at this time.
The story then begins with the descent of the Lord Buddha from heaven, and continues until his first earthly sermon as Prince Siddhartha.
Jatakas are stories about the Buddha before he was born as Prince Siddhartha.
Both are depicted in the same series of reliefs.
This is the story told in the final chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra about Sudhana's tireless wandering in search of the highest perfect wisdom.

The museum is open daily 06:00-18:00 and entry is included with the main Borobudur ticket.
Around Borobudur[edit][add listing]Between Yogyakarta and Magelang lies the volcanic Kedu Plain.

There is a lot written in travel guides about the pushy nature of the vendors at Borobudur.
And they can be a little annoying it must be said.
Yogyakarta is a student town with many colleges and Universities, and you will often find many students at Borobudur who are keen to be friendly with you.
Alternatively, visit as early as you can in the morning.
If you look vaguely Western, you'll be a bigger tourist attraction to school students than the monument itself.
If you want to see a serious active volcano, Mount Merapi is about a 2 hour drive to the east.
However if you are based in Yogyakarta or other locations and not driving yourself , there are 'tours' or 'climbing' ventures, that in most cases leave from Yogyakarta, and drive to Selo (located in the valley between Merbabu and Merapi) which is a traditional location to walk to the top of Merapi in the middle of the night for the dawn views.

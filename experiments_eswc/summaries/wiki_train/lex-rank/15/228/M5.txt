There were about 1,000 slaves and about 5,000 Mexicans.
Presidential duties were left to the vice president, and he began a bold move against conservative forces: the army and the Church.
Texas had been united with the state of Coahuila back in 1824, and the convention called for Texas to become an independent state within Mexico.
The convention sent Stephen Austin to Mexico City with their request for reform.
In November, the Anglo-Americans defied Santa Anna by voting to defend Mexico's 1824 constitution, and volunteers began arriving from the United States to take part in a war against Santa Anna.
When Cós had surrendered to the Anglos he had promised to take his men with him out of Texas and fight the Anglos no more, but Cós joined his few hundred men with those of Santa Anna.
They decided to hold up at the place of victory against Cós – the Alamo.
Most of the Anglos at the Alamo followed the commander there, Colonel William Travis, and stayed to fight.
Santa Anna assumed that he had defeated the Anglos of Texas, and he relaxed.
On April 20, Santa Anna, now with a force of around 1,110 men, met a force of 800 men led by Sam Houston, near the San Jacinto River, on the eastern side of what is now the city of Houston.
Houston treated Santa Anna as a guest, and he won from Santa Anna a pledge to end the fighting and to withdraw Mexico's army from Texas.
A second pledge by Santa Anna remained secret, an agreement by Santa Anna to prepare Mexico City to receive a peace delegation from Texas for formal recognition of the independence of Texas.
In 1837, the United States officially recognized Texas as independent.

Manhattan Project United States history Written by: The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica
Alternative title: Atomic Research Laboratory Manhattan Project, U.S. government research project (1942–45) that produced the first atomic bombs.
On December 6, 1941, the project was put under the direction of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, headed by Vannevar Bush.
The explosive materials then had to be produced and be made suitable for use in an actual weapon.
These methods were put into production at a 70-square-mile (180-square-km) tract near Knoxville, Tennessee, originally known as the Clinton Engineer Works, later as Oak Ridge.
Most of these problems had to be solved before any appreciable amount of fissionable material could be produced, so that the first adequate amounts could be used at the fighting front with minimum delay.
By the summer of 1945, amounts of plutonium-239 sufficient to produce a nuclear explosion had become available from the Hanford Works, and weapon development and design were sufficiently far advanced so that an actual field test of a nuclear explosive could be scheduled.

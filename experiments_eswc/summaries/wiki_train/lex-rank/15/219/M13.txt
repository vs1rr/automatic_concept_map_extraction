Oliphant's father was a very religious man and he wanted his oldest son to be a priest, but Oliphant had always been more interested in gadgets and science than in religion.
To pay for his education he took any odd job he could find, working his way through university.
He was so impressed by what Rutherford had to say that he immediately decided that if he could possibly bring it about, he would work for Rutherford one day.
In 1937 Oliphant took a position with the University of Birmingham, where he became a professor of physics.
He there met Ernest Lawrence, who taught Oliphant how to build a 60-inch cyclotron.
World War II Brought About Atom Bomb In 1940
two men, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, who also worked at the University of Birmingham, theorized that uranium-235 could be used to create an atom bomb.
After the use of the bomb in 1945 on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, however, he was appalled by the devastation, and argued against its ever being used again. "
Although he had been sent to press America to build a bomb, no one at the time knew how devastating such a bomb would be, and Oliphant has said he would not have pressed for its creation if he had known.
It was while he was there that he first heard how the atom bomb was used and exactly how powerful it was.
Because of the work he did during the war, Oliphant was given a Congressional Medal of Freedom with Gold Palm, but the Australian government vetoed the honor.
There he became the first director of the Research School of Physical Sciences at the new Australian National University in Canberra.
Became State Governor of South Australia
He retired from the Australian National University in 1967.
He will be remembered as the scientist who unwillingly helped to build the atomic bomb, but who stuck by his principles in trying to stop the further development and use of nuclear weapons.

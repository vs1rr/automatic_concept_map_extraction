Photographer Martin Miller traveled to two nuclear-explosives production facilities constructed during the infamous mission to build the world's first atomic bomb - a uranium production plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and a full-scale plutonium protection reactor in Hanford, Washington.

These were the astonishing sites where the bombs were developed with two billion dollars, years of labour and expert engineering.

The Hanford Engineering Works in Washington worked to create plutonium on a massive scale by bombarding U238 with neutrons originating from fission of U235.

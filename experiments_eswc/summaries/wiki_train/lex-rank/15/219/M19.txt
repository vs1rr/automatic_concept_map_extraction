Topical Template:PlainlistThe Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II.
Most of this work was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
The gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon was developed in a concerted design and construction effort at the project's principal research and design laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
[10]April 10: MAUD Committee established by Tizard to investigate feasibility of an atomic bomb.
[15]May 17: A report by Arthur Compton and the National Academy of Sciences is issued which finds favorable the prospects of developing nuclear power production for military use.
[18]July 2: The MAUD Committee chooses James Chadwick to write the second (and final) draft of its report on the design and costs of developing a bomb.
[21]October 9: Bush takes MAUD Report to Roosevelt, who approves Project to confirm MAUD's findings.
The United States and Great Britain issue a formal declaration of war against Japan the next day.
[41]1943January 16: Groves approves development of the Hanford Site.
[42]February 18: Construction begins for Y-12, a massive electromagnetic separation plant for enriching uranium at Oak Ridge.
[43]April 1: Los Alamos laboratory is established.
[47]July 10: First sample of plutonium arrives at Los Alamos.
[51]September 8: First meeting of the Combined Policy Committee, established by the Quebec Agreement to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.
[57]April 5: At Los Alamos, Emilio Segrè receives the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from Oak Ridge, and within ten days discovers that the spontaneous fission rate is too high for use in a gun-type fission weapon.
[69]February 2: First Hanford plutonium arrives at Los Alamos.
[71]April 27: First meeting of the Target Committee.
[66]May 10: Second meeting of the Target Committee, at Los Alamos.
[86]September 4: Manhattan District orders shutdown of S-50 liquid thermal diffusion plant and the Y-12 Alpha plant.
[87]September 8: Manhattan Project survey group under Farrell arrives in Nagasaki.

Immediately after World War II, on 29 August 1945, the new Labor government headed by Prime Minister Clement Attlee convened a organized a secret Cabinet committee on atomic energy to establish nuclear policy.
Attlee appointed a team of three senior leaders of the British atomic energy program in late January 1946.
The initial sites for Britain's nuclear program were also elected in 1946.

Penney who had a prominent part of the British Mission at Los Alamos during the war.
Shortly before D-Day he had left his teaching post at Imperial College in London and travelled to Los Alamos at the request of G. I. Taylor.
At Los Alamos Penney's principal assignment was studying the damage effects from the blast wave of the atomic bomb, but he became involved in implosion studies as well and spent up to half his time working in this area.
Penney was soon called away from his post in London at the request of General Groves to participate in the first post-war nuclear test called Operation Crossroads.
On 8 January 1947 the secret GEN.163 Cabinet committee of six Ministers (headed by PM Attlee) decided to proceed with development and acquisition of atomic weapons.
Although BHER was responsible for the overall weapon design, and the development and fabrication of the implosion system, the manufacture of the plutonium core initially resided with the plutonium production program under Hinton.
A site for the first plutonium production reactors and plutonium processing plant was selected at Sellafield on the Irish Sea coast in Cumberland.
This plant finally began operation in 1953.
15 September 1952 the plutonium core for the first British nuclear device, code named Hurricane, left England.
The entire expedition fleet consisted of five ships (the Campania, the sacrificial test ship Plym, and three landing craft) and 1500 men, a fraction of the size of the Crossroads operation.

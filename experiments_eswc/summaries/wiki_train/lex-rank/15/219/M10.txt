University of Birmingham's pivotal role in the invention of nuclear weapons Two Edgbaston-based physicists changed the world with their calculations, writes Peter Douglas OsbornA nuclear bomb
It was 75 years ago that two Birmingham-based scientists published a document which set science on the path to the nuclear bomb – a breakthrough which would change the world.
But in the University of Birmingham’s physics department, these two researchers were to work for another two years, at benches side by side, and with crucial access to the cyclotron.
Then if that happened, and two shaped pieces were exploded together it could be predicted that a chain reaction would take place, and a temperature as hot as the core of the Sun would be achieved.
The Peierls and Frisch memorandum, with their calculations, was then sent post haste to the Government and research was funded to see if it were possible to produce a British version before the Nazis managed it.
From that the ‘Manhattan Project’ was born, and, with British help, the bomb was developed in time to end the war.

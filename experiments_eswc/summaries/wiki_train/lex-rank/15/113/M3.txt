A monk was waiting for us in front of five beautiful stone statues, which were displayed in a bank of water.
The monk introduced himself before giving us a brief introduction to Buddhism.
There was a stone statue of a starving Buddha and another of the Buddha after he had found a balance.
It was only in 1814 that it was re-discovered.
For example, on the first level which is that of desire, there were stories about gossip, prostitution and alcohol.
Our tour guide took us to each level and explained some of the stories.

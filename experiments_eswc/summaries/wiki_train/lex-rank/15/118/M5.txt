Initially a stone keep was built which was surrounded by a wooden perimeter.
Through the marriage of Robert de Vieuxpont's great grand-daughter to Roger Clifford the castle changed hands and stayed in the Clifford family for 4 centuries.
In 1296 the wars with Scotland heightened and the then owner, Robert Clifford, developed the castle with a gatehouse, top storey to the keep, the Tower of League in the castle's southwest corner and the stone curtain wall.

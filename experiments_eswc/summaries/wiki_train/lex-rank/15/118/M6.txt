A Roman fort originally occupied the site of the current Brougham Castle.
By 1268 the castle had passed to Robert Clifford, whose father Roger had become Lord of Brougham when he married Robert Vieuxpoint’s great-granddaughter.
On the second floor is the lord’s chamber, in which Lady Anne slept when she stayed here, and in which she died.
The Eamont flows in to the top right of the picture from Ullwater, at Pooley Bridge.

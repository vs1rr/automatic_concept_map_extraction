The site was later taken by the Norman family of Vieuxpont to build their castle, the ruins of which can still be seen.
The remainder of the 14th century was a troubled and bloody one, and the castle was more or less ruined by the Scots.
In 1660 Lady Anne Clifford began her restoration work on Brougham castle and chose to make it her home.

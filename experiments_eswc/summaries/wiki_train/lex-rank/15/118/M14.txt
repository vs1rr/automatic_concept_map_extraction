Then much of it was destroyed by the Scottish army, except for the outer walls and the base of the keep.
It remained in a state of disrepair until 1661 when Lady Anne Clifford took an interest, as she did with Brougham and Appleby, and started restoration works on the castle.
In 1663 a plaque was erected in the castle to commemorate Lady Anne's efforts in the restoration.
The castle is now cared for by English Heritage.

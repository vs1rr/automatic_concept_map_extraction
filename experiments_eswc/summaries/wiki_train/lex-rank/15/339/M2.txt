After losing the 1777 election for the Virginia Assembly, he was appointed to the Council of State (1777-79).
He served as Virginia’s representative to the Continental Congress from 1780 to 1783, and as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1784 to 1787.
This was the first plan considered by the Convention, and many of its elements were incorporated into the Constitution in its final form.
Madison was elected to Congress under the new Constitution, where he served from 1789 until 1797.
At the conclusion of Jefferson’s second term, Madison was inaugurated as the fourth president of the United States (1809-17), inheriting the unresolved issues stemming from the war between France and Great Britain.
In his eulogy, friend and neighbor Governor James Barbour expressed “hope that the life of Madison ... may become a pillar of light by which some future patriot may reconduct his countrymen to their lost inheritance.”

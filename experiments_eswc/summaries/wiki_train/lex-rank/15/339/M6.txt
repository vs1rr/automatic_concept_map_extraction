Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions or Virginia and Kentucky Resolves of 1798 were two separate but similar influential statements that state governments could stop certain actions of the federal U.S. government.
They were resolutions passed by the state legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia, respectively, in 1798, but not accepted by the other states.
The secret author of Virginia Resolutions was James Madison, while the Kentucky Resolutions were secretly written by Thomas Jefferson.
Jefferson at one point drafted a threat for Virginia to secede, but dropped it from the text.
[1] These were given to allies and passed by the state legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky, but other states refused to pass similar resolutions.
The ideas underlying the Resolutions also influenced the Southern secession in the 1860s, which resulted in the American Civil War.

"THE only spirits at the Police College are those behind the bar", said the Chief Superintendent, and laughed as a trainee police officer from India narrated to him his experience of that morning of an encounter with a spirit in the chapel drawing room of the Bramshill, housing the most prestigious Police College of Britain.
That morning in October, 1986, as the police officer from India, under training at the Bramshill, was passing through the huge chapel drawing room, he came across an area where he smelt a fragrance, pleasing and soft.
There was no doubt the fragrance was there.
He walked back into the area in front of the cushioned chairs, to find again that it held the scent.
The Chief Superintendent volunteered the information that the Bramshill House was haunted by no less than 14 spirits and that the most important feature of the White Lady was that she announced her presence with a strong floral fragrance, the smell of the arum lilies or the lily-of-the-valley.
One legend has it that when the chest was in Italy, Genevre Orsini, who was 15, had suffered the ghastly fate described above in 1727.
An exorcism had had no effect.
Ronald had died in tragic circumstances 30 years back.
The panelled hall with the mistletoe bough chest is haunted by the ghost of old man with a long beard, and the chapel drawing room by the ghost of a woman from the days of Queen Anne.
There is also a path in the grounds of the Bramshill haunted by ‘the Gardener’, who was drowned in a lake in the north-west side.
The part of the wall through which the man had walked, there used to be an archway, which had been blocked and plastered years ago.

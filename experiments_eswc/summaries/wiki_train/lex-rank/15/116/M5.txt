[1]MarriageIn or around 1578, Zouche married his cousin Eleanor Zouche, daughter of Sir John Zouche and Eleanor, n√©e Whalley.
[2]Within a year of his first wife's death, Zouche married again, to Sarah, daughter of Sir James Harington.
He was also interested in horticulture; his house in Hackney included a physic garden and he employed Matthias L'Obel as his gardener.
James I stayed at Bramshill in 1620 and the next year George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, went down to Bramshill to consecrate a chapel for Lord Zouche.
Although all the witnesses, including Zouche, agreed that it was a tragic accident, Abbot's reputation never recovered from the fact that he was the only Archbishop of Canterbury ever to kill a man.
Mystery of More children on the Mayflower In 1959, a document was found in the house of Sir Jasper More that solved a mystery concerning four children who travelled to America on the Mayflower in 1620.
[11] This was done on the counsel of Lord Zouche, who was a Virginia Company commissioner,[17][18] acting on the request of Samuel More and his father Richard, who were searching for a location far away to which the children could be sent.

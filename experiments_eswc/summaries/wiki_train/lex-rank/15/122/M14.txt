By 1514 the site was owned by William Compton.
In the surviving building, the main fabric is made up of original Tudor bricks.
By 1626 the house and land was owned by Hugh Hare, 1st Lord Coleraine.
‘... being at supper one night and talking merrily with some gentlemen of his acquaintance and having a turkey bone in his mouth, it was hard hap through extreme laughter to cause it to go down the wrong way which was ye the instrument of his death.’
Henry Hare, second Lord Coleraine Constantia Lucy, Lady Coleraine Sarah, dowager Duchess of Somerset Henry Hare, 2nd Lord Coleraine inherited the house and moved in with his young wife Constantia Lucy.
This included the raising of the turret projections and the building of the clock tower above the porch.
After Wilmot’s death Bruce Castle was purchased by John Ede and then in 1827 by the Hill Family.
It was a very popular school and boys came from around the world to Bruce Castle School.

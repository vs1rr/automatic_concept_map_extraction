Qype User gotige…London83 friends92 reviews Share review4.0 star rating23/6/2008This is an excellent museum on many levels.
It would be fair to say the exhibit would benefit from an update, but for those with an interest in London's built and social evolution will find it fascinating and easily worth the visit.

The park that the museum is set in has some fantastic old oak trees.

When I was there we had a picnic and it was lovely day.
It is a good place to go on a weekend to have a look at the museum and the local archives.

Bruce Castle or Lordship House Bruce Castle is a misnomer, a historical cheat.
It is a manor house in Tottenham in London and was just plain Lordship House for most of its existence.
At the time Robert the Bruce seized the throne of Scotland to become King Robert I, part of the manorial estate of Tottenham belonged to him.
The manor house was named Lordship House well into the 17th century when the name was changed to Bruce Castle by its owner Henry Hare, Baron Coleraine.
Hugh married one of the Manchester daughters from the Earlâ€™s first marriage.
With these connections securely in place, he was ready to enter court and acquire the title of Baron Coleraine.

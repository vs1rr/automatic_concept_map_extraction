The End of the Byzantine Empire The restored Byzantine Empire converted to Catholicism to get aid from the West against the Turks, but the Turks defeated them and established the Ottoman Empire.
The West would only provide the East with help against the Turks if the East converted from Orthodox to Catholic Christianity.
On May 29, 1453 CE, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks and the Byzantine Empire came to an end.
By 1400 CE, the Byzantine Empire was little more than the city-state of Constantinople.
In other words, the Orthodox Byzantines considered it better to be ruled by the Muslim Turks than to go against their religious beliefs and give in to the Catholic Church.
Yet in 1453 they fell to the Ottoman Turks.

The Byzantine Empire Constantinople was built on the site of an ancient Greek trading city called Byzantium.
After Rome fell in 476, the emperors of the eastern Roman Empire dreamed of taking it back, and reuniting the old Roman Empire.
Justinian was the last roman Emperor of the Eastern Empire.
The people thought of themselves as Romans, but they were actually of the Byzantine Empire named after a Greek town of Byzantium.
The power of an eastern emperor was greater because the emperor was considered the head of the church as well as the political leader.
The Byzantines thought the emperor was chosen by God to lead both the empire and the church.
In time, eastern and western Christianity presented differently.
In the 1000s, Christianity in the East broke away from the rest of the church and formed what later became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church.

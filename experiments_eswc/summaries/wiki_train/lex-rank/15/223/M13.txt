The Byzantine emperor had helped Khosrau regain the throne of the Sassanid Empire in 591, and the two remained friends until Maurice was executed by Phocas in 602.
And so, he sent an army, under the command of Kardarigan, to relieve the siege of Edessa.
Phocas responded with another army, this time focused on driving the Sassanid army back to Persia.
Phocas was in dire straights now as his empire was under attack from both the east and south.
And why not?
In 612, the Persian army, under the command of general Shahrbaraz, conquered Syria, cutting the Byzantine Empire in half.
But in the end, Jerusalem fell in 613 to the Sassanid Empire.
But in 618, they were on the move again.
Shahrbaraz had no choice but to turn back and attack Heraclius.
So Heraclius invaded in 624.
And so, Shahraplakan rushed his men to take part in the attack so he could receive his accolades.
Survivors of the first two armies who managed to escape, joined up with Shahrbaraz's army and it pursued the Byzantines.
While Shahrbaraz was sending his 6,000 troops to attack the Byzantines, Heraclius was doubling back to attack the main Sassanid army at Aliovit at night.
Shahrbaraz, who survived the attack on Aliovit, was given another army (either he still had Khosrau's trust or Khosrau had no one else to turn to) and once again set out to cut off Heraclius' retreat.
This time they met at the Sarus River, the two armies on opposite sides.
Even so, the Sassanids failed to guard the bridge, and Heraclius crossed it with the rest of his army.
Now it was Heraclius' turn.
He had an alliance of his own up his sleeve.
Heraclius made a treaty with them, and 40,000 Turks invaded the Sassanid Empire shortly after the siege on Constantinople.
Now it was Khosrau who was in a desperate situation.
But Heraclius was in no position to attack the fortified capital of the Sassanid Empire.
Knowing that a complete victory was not possible, Heraclius once again extended an offer of peace to Khosrau.

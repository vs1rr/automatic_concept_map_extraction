The Turks started to settle in Anatolia during the period of the Great Seljuk Empire in the early 11th century.
Over a span of nearly a hundred years, the Turks fully conquered the Anatolian heartland and established the Anatolian Seljuk State as a part of the Great Seljuk Empire (1075-1318).
The Seljuk Empire was the first Turkish Empire in Anatolia.

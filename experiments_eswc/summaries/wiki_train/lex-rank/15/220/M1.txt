It has now however turned out to be true.
Some time zone boundaries have been changed since 1937.
The "British Empire" was not a de jure entity (like the Roman Empire, German Empire, Austrian Empire, Russian Empire, or Japanese Empire), since Britain itself was a kingdom (the "United Kingdom" of Great Britain and Ireland,or Northern Ireland in 1937).
One British possession, however, was an empire, namely India, where British rule comes to be called the "Raj," , or .
"Empire" had been used this way long before there was any 19th century ideology on the subject, for it or against it.
The power of Britain at its height was almost entirely a function of that of Great Britain itself, as the power of the later Holy Rome Emperors was almost entirely a function of that of the Hapsburgs.
While India was the "Jewel in the Crown" of the Empire, its role in British power was also unlike the possessions of more conventional Empires.
By all the ordinary dynamics of Empire (or at least Roman Empire), an educated Indian could be expected to circulate freely among Englishmen, possess the same dignity and freedom as other Subjects of Queen Victoria, and reasonably be expected to participate in the Government of his own country, as many British had already said that modernized Indians could be expected to do.
This policy, however perverse, could be partially maintained in India after the Mutiny, by way of the Princely States, but much of India already was ruled directly by the British Crown.
Eugenics remained popular in some circles for decades, and not just in Nazi Germany.
If Indians were racially inferior and could not be trusted to rule their own country, how could one of them become a Member of Parliament in Britain itself?
While it was assumed by one and all that India added a substantial increment to British power and perhaps even constituted a major portion of what was needed by Britain for Great Power status, the economic development of the country, even after the growth fostered by British investment and modernization, was so relatively backward that there was little that India, which certainly had been one of the Great Powers of the Earth in the 16th century, contributed in modern terms.
However, the British garrison in India was there in large part to secure India, and prevent another Mutiny, not to otherwise be used for British military purposes.
In the sphere of influence of the Indian Government, the Indian Army, British and Native, could be used for local purposes.
In those terms, Britain was riding an Indian Empire that might be functioning much as it would, as a regional Power, if the British weren't even there.
A few Indian troops were used in Europe in World War I, but the value of the Indian Army was otherwise within the range we might expect, in Mesopotamia in World War I and then Malaya and Burma in World War II.
When India and Pakistan became independent in 1947, the Indian Empire ceased to exist and both countries became, for a time, Dominions -- the category for previous British self-governing territories, starting with Canada (1867) and later coming to include the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and, for a time (1926-1934), little Newfoundland (which did not join Canada until 1949).
Indeed, if the Holy Roman Empire was in some ways analogous to the British Empire, then the Commonwealth may be compared to the German Confederation of 1815, where there was no pretense that the sovereignty of its members was in the least compromised by the largely symbolic organization of the whole.
In retrospect, "Empire" was never the best term for the constellation of British possessions.
The status of a "hegemon" is something that we also find very far from Greece.
The foreign bases of the United States, although many, and from which it can project its power, beyond what can even be done with its substantial naval forces, consist of no sovereign American territory -- except in the chain of islands, Midway, Wake, and Guam, that were acquired in the 19th century in imitation of Britain.
The United States clearly does not have an Empire; but it is also, clearly, a hegemon, .
This status may be as fragile as it was for Athens, or for Britain, but the territorial heart of the United States is also a much greater source of power than was that of Athens, Britain, the Hapsburgs, Macedon, or the typical Spring and Autumn state.
Britain lost not just the will to Empire but the power for hegemony.
Lloyd's The British Empire, 1558-1995, and for investment in Lloyd and John Darwin's Unfinished Empire, so both sets of figures from are given.
However, as David Hume noted as early as 1752, this really just means that enough money is exported to make up the difference.
Indeed, when Americans in the 1980's worried about the Japanese buying up the United States, the largest foreign investors were actually British -- which for the future meant American growth rather than British growth.
Indeed, the only trade surpluses in the table are with India, Africa, the West Indies, and the Far East, which might give some heart to Marxist claims that British colonies, especially India, were the outlet for Capitalist "excess production. "
However, the trade surpluses are small, and overall British trade with India and the other colonies is hardly larger than with the much, much smaller populations of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.
Indeed, Europe, the United States, Australia, Canada, etc.
Lenin saw British colonies as the necessary outlet for British capital, as well as for British capitalist "overproduction. "
Meanwhile, Australia, always resentful of much of what happened in World War I (at Gallipoli) and in World War II (at Singapore and in Burma), contains a powerful movement to become a Republic.
Elsewhere, switches from left to right reflect the decline in British influence.
Otherwise, major former British possessions, like a large part of Africa, India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, etc.
But if the reality of the power of the later Holy Roman Emperors was actually the power of the Hapsburgs, and the power of the British Empire was Britain, what happened to that power?
But Britain hurried its decline with the dynamic of its own attitudes.
For the key to British power was the Industrial Revolution.
But even Uncle Matthew, with the experience of Mitford's father in India, was an internationalist compared to the greatest caricature of the English in English history, the "Hobbits" of J.R.R.
This was bad enough, and it had its effect.
had been passed to the United States, and the British more or less forgot that they had simply dropped that torch, as it were, as they prepared to rule the Wogs for their own good.
But even if the British were better stewards of African economies, isn't it still true that they simply did not have the right to rule other people against their will?
The Pax Britannica, like the Pax Romana, may have involved some little wars going on someplace most of the time, but the overall effect was to render trade and travel safe in a way that they usually had not been previously.
There is also the fate of a place like Ceylon.
Thus, the conflict between Tamils and Sinhalese in Ceylon long antedates, by centuries, the arrival of the British, or any Europeans.
This did not do anyone any good.
Unfortunately, even if it had, this sort of structure for government has still not been perfected.

The list of Princely States in India is complete according to Wikipedia, but I also see that there were something like 600 of them, which is nothing like what you see here.
He felt that this was a breach of faith; and perhaps it was -- but an inevitable one.

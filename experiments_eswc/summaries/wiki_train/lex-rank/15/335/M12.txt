In fact, there were no laws against witchcraft in Britain until 1542, when Henry VIII passed an act against witchcraft and conjuration.
In 1441 she stood accused of employing a magician named Roger Bolingbroke and a wise-woman named Margery Jourdemayne to kill Henry VI by sorcery.
Commoners such as Jourdemayne were rarely caught up in such intrigues, but the tables would be turned more than a century later when witchcraft was seen to be a pervasive problem.
Elizabeth Frauncis confessed that she had been taught witchcraft at the age of 12 by her grandmother.
She had given her blood to the Devil in the likeness of a white-spotted cat, which she kept in a basket and fed.
Frauncis was imprisoned, Agnes Waterhouse was hanged for committing murder by witchcraft, and Joan was found not guilty.
Accusations were made in both Scotland and Denmark that witches had been employed to kill the couple.
4) 1594:
Gwen Ellis is the first witch to be executed in Wales The witch trials were at their peak in England when, in June 1594, Gwen Ellis, a woman in her early forties who had been married three times, was taken to Flint gaol on suspicion of witchcraft.
Alison confessed that she had made a pact with the Devil under the instruction of her grandmother, Old Demdike, and had bewitched Law in revenge.
One of them, an old woman, confessed to having made a pact with the Devil in the guise of a tall black man.
7) 1697: six people are executed on the word of an 11-year-oldWhile the last documented execution for witchcraft in England took place in1682, three men and four women were sentenced to death in Paisley, Scotland, in 1697 for committing murder by witchcraft.
Six of them were hanged and burned for witchcraft â€“ and one committed suicide before the sentence was carried out.
This was the first time a Scottish witch trial had been triggered by alleged demonic possession â€“ a remarkable fact given that such instances of possession had been prosecuted in England and Europe for decades.

The Pendle Witches Perhaps the most notorious witch trial of the 17th century, the legend of the Pendle witches is one of the many dark tales of imprisonment and execution at Lancaster Castle.
It was an unusual trial in that it was documented in an official publication, The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster, by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts.
It was a short while after this that John Law suffered a stroke, for which he blamed Alizon and her powers.
It was upon further questioning that Alizon accused her grandmother, Old Demdike, and also members of the Chattox family, of witchcraft.
James Demdike confessed that Alizon had also cursed a local child some time before and Elizabeth, although more reserved in making accusations, confessed her mother had a mark on her body, supposedly where the Devil had sucked her blood, which left her mad.
The story would have ended there had it not been for a meeting held at Malkin Tower by James Device (Alizonâ€™s brother), for which he stole a neighbourâ€™s sheep.
Alizon Device was one of those who believed in her own powers and was also the only one on trial who was faced with one of their victims, John Law.

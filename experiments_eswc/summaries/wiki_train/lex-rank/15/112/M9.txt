There is a lot of nonsense talked about the four symbols that are used in the Book of Kells:- LION; MAN; CALF and EAGLE.
Judah's standard is a LION; Reuben's standard is a MAN; Joseph / Ephraim's standard is a wild-ox CALF (which today has become a Unicorn) and Dan's standard is an EAGLE.
One of those names makes their identity more obvious than the others and that name is the Tuatha de Danaan - the Tribe of Dan; who was the fifth of Jacob/Israel's twelve sons.
The four tribal standards previously mentioned as being on the pages of the famous Book of Kells are also mentioned by Christ to his Apostle John in Christ's Apocalypse/Revelation.
The four emblems represent the tribes of Israel to whom the Gospels were to be preached and that is why they are, quite rightly, on the pages of the "Book of Kells", in Ireland, because the Irish are Israelites, as I have previously explained.

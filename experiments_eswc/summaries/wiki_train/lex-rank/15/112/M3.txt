The Book of Kells by Laura King Throughout all of art history, one of the most distinct styles and types has been that of the Irish, or Celtic art.
What is curious and interesting about all this, is that twelve hundred years after it is known that the Book has been in existence, there is still controversy over its exact origins.
The theories of present are that the Book of Kells was created in either Kells, an island between Ireland and Scotland called Iona, or from a church in Northumberland.
One of the main, and most important pigments of yellow used in the Book of Kells is orpiment, the other, though less used shade yellow came from yellow ochre, which is a naturally occurring mineral.
The green shades used in the Book of Kells comes from a copper pigment, to be exact the mineral malachite.
After spending eight hundred and fifty years there it moved to Dublin, and shortly after that to its current home in the Trinity College Library where it was put on display and can still be seen today.

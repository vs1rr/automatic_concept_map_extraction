—Excerpt from the license to crenellate allowing Edward Dalyngrigge to build a castle from the Patent Rolls of 1385–89Instead of refortifying his existing manor house, as the license from Richard II premitted, Dalyngrigge decided instead to build his castle from sandstone on a new spot.
Sir Edward lived in the castle of only three years, until his death in 1395, when it was passed on to his son, John, also a favorite knight of the king.
Sir Thomas Lewknor supported the House of Lancaster during the War of the Roses, so in 1483 when Richard III of the House of York was made king, Lewknor was out of favor.
Whether the siege actually took place is not recorded, but it is likely that the castle yielded quickly.
It was his son, John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet who was finally able to reunite the castle and manor when he bought Bodiam Castle in 1639.
It is suggested that he purchased the castle to keep the Websters from dismantling it and reusing the building materials.
Upon Cubitt’s death, Lord Curzon purchased the land from Cubitt’s son in 1916.
Lord Curzon then gave the castle to the nation, and it has been maintained by the National Trust since 1925.
The castle maintained twenty-eight toilets, which all drained into the moat.

CSI Effect What is the CSI Effect?
Definition:The CSI effect is a belief held primarily among law enforcement personnel and prosecutors that forensic science television dramas, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, influence American jurors to expect more forensic evidence in order to convict defendants of crimes.
Shelton said they saw more of a “tech effect” where jurors are influenced by advances in technology rather than what they watch on television.

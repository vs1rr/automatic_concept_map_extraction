That is the question behind several studies on the so-called CSI Effect: jurors who watch CSI or other crime dramas are influenced by the shows’ exaggerated portrayal of forensic science and measure their experience (and decisions) as a juror against fictional Hollywood standards.
“Like the unicorn and the mermaid,” the study reports, “the CSI Effect is a myth.”
So, it looks like CSI and other crime dramas are in the clear.
But without a television scapegoat, what is to blame for high expectations of scientific evidence in criminal trials?
In Science We Trust What might startle jurors is the lack of science in forensic science.
By comparison, microscopic hair analysis (without DNA) is highly unreliable with little scientific backing and no standards for declaring a match.
And sometimes, admittedly, it is more interesting to watch what can go wrong than what can go right in forensic science.

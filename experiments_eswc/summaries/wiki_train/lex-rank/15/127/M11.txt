It is easy to defend a fortress, but fortresses are not designed with the comfort of a king or queen in mind.
Castles were originally built in England by Norman invaders in 1066.
Not limited to military purposes, castles also served as offices from which the lord would administer control over his fiefdom.
Since these castles were constructed from wood, they were highly susceptible to attacks by fire.
Wooden castles were gradually replaced by stone, which greatly increased the strength of these fortifications; however, being made from stone did not make these castles entirely fireproof.
These towers were connected to the castle by wooden bridges, so that if one tower fell, the rest of the castle was still easy to defend.
Multiple rings of castle walls were constructed, so that even if attackers made it past one wall, they would be caught on a killing ground between inner and outer walls.
Though castles no longer serve their original purposes, remaining castles receive millions of visitors each year from those who wish to experience these majestic vestiges of a time long passed.

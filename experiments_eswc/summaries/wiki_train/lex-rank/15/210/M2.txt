So, when we head into the desert, what exactly is our point of departure?
If we are drawn to the desert in Lent that means that we are called to leave Egypt.
One was in Mesopotamia.
As we are called to head into the desert into Lent, then, it helps to remember our point of departure: Egypt.
For the ancient Israelites it meant enslavement, but it also was a place of comfort and certainty.
During Lent, then, we not only must have the courage and faith not only to go into the desert, but also to leave Egypt behind us.

By harnessing the power of the Nile River, and learning the consistency of the rise and fall of its water levels, they built their empire from what could have been barren wasteland; and with the use ofthe water, and an irrigation system, along with the sands, and thousands of slaves, the ancient Egyptians built the huge monuments of sand that still stand as proof of their ingenuity (Baines, 2000).
Though the ancient Egyptians did not dedicate a lot of deities or time to the worship of the Nile, it is responsible for the many religious artifacts this great society left behind, from the Great Pyramids - built with its waters,and mummies that were preserved because of its influence on their religion.
The Nile River was also responsible for papyrus, or the form of paper, used to record Egyptian writing.

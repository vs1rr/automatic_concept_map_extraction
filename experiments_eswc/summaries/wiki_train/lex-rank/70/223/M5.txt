The Fall of the Roman Empire Constantine the Great, 306-337 C.E., divided the Roman Empire in two and made Christianity the dominant religion in the region.
The Visigoths looted, burned, and pillaged their way through the city, leaving a wake of destruction wherever they went.
For the first time in nearly a millennium, the city of Rome was in the hands of someone other than the Romans.
This was the first time that the city of Rome was sacked, but by no means the last.
Constantine and the Rise of Christianity One of the many factors that contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire was the rise of a new religion, Christianity.
The Christian religion, which was monotheistic ran counter to the traditional Roman religion, which was polytheistic (many gods).

In 313 C.E., Roman emperor Constantine the Great ended all persecution and declared toleration for Christianity.
Later that century, Christianity became the official state religion of the Empire.
Finally, by this time, Romans considered their emperor a god.
But the Christian belief in one god — who was not the emperor — weakened the authority and credibility of the emperor.
In 330 C.E., he split the empire into two parts: the western half centered in Rome and the eastern half centered in Constantinople, a city he named after himself.
This map of the Roman Empire in 476 C.E. shows the various people who invaded and how they carved up the Empire.
In 324, Constantine's army defeated the forces of Licinius, the emperor of the east.
Constantine became emperor of the entire empire and founded a new capital city in the eastern half at Byzantium.
The city was his New Rome and was later named Constantinople (the "city of Constantine").
as the western Empire collapsed.
Constantinople was advantageously situated for two reasons.
First, it was on a peninsula that could be fortified and defended easily.
Some scholars also believe that Constantine established a new city in order to provide a place for the young religion of Christianity to grow in an environment purer than that of corrupt Rome.
The eastern Empire spoke Greek and worshipped under the Eastern Orthodox branch of the Christian church.
In fact, after the western part of the Roman Empire fell, the eastern half continued to exist as the Byzantine Empire for hundreds of years.
Therefore, the "fall of Rome" really refers only to the fall of the western half of the Empire.
The western half of the empire had a large trade deficit with the eastern half.
The west purchased luxury goods from the east but had nothing to offer in exchange.
This led to inflation.
Finally, piracy and attacks from Germanic tribes disrupted the flow of trade, especially in the west.
It didn't help matters that political amateurs were in control of Rome in the years leading up to its fall.
Army generals dominated the emperorship, and corruption was rampant.
Over time, the military was transformed into a mercenary army with no real loyalty to Rome.
As money grew tight, the government hired the cheaper and less reliable Germanic soldiers to fight in Roman armies.
By the end, these armies were defending Rome against their fellow Germanic tribesmen.
Groups such as the Visigoths, Vandals, Angles, Saxons, Franks, Ostrogoths, and Lombards took turns ravaging the Empire, eventually carving out areas in which to settle down.
The Angles and Saxons populated the British Isles, and the Franks ended up in France.
In 476 C.E. Romulus, the last of the Roman emperors in the west, was overthrown by the Germanic leader Odoacer, who became the first Barbarian to rule in Rome.
The order that the Roman Empire had brought to western Europe for 1000 years was no more.

We spoke about the california gold rush.
The california gold rush is a period in the american history after the discovery of gold by James W. Marshall in Suttler's Mill in California.
Who is James W. Marshall?
James Wilson Marshall was an american carpenter.
He was driven from his land by the gold diggers and could never enjoy his wealth discovery.
This discovery of gold leads to the gold rush in California.
These « forty niners » came by sailing ships and covered wagons on the whole continent.
They come to search for gold and strike it rich.
This gold rush helps the country's developpment.
Then, it also helps the development of the country in terms of agricluture and the creation of a govnement leading to the admission of California as an american State in 1850.
Indeed, many native americans were driven from their land, racial and ethnic tensions begun and the extraction of gold led many environmental problems.

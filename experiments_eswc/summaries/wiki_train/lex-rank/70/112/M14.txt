The Book of Kells at Trinity College, DublinBY CHRISTA THOMPSON // DECEMBER 17, 2013
TWEETSHAREIreland’s Finest National Treasure During my recent visit to Dublin, Ireland I was able to make my way over to the Old Library at Trinity College, home to the Book of Kells Exhibit.
Made ca.
800 (or even earlier) by Celtic monks, is an illuminated manuscript written in Latin that contains the four Gospels of the New Testament.
Mainly based on the Vulgate, it also contains passages from early versions of the Bible, the Vetus Latina.
Its extravagant illustrations and ornate details surmounts other Insular Gospel books.
It’s manuscript’s pages are decorated in great detail depicting humans, animals and mythological beasts.
Manuscript has 340 folios.
Written on calf vellum.
Lettering is in iron gall ink.
Colors imported from far away lands many made from plant and animal pigments.
Named after the Abbey of Kells in Co Meath where it lived for centuries.
The manuscript was never finished.
The Fairytale Traveler Experience at the Book of Kells:The entire first floor of the Book of Kells exhibit is set up nicely as a self guided tour through blown up illuminated replicas of the manuscript.
Well worth the extra cheddar.
You’re not allowed to photograph the exhibit downstairs so, best I can explain is it’s stunning, well laid out, and easy to work through.
It is guided by numbers leading to the back where there are 2 displays of actual manuscripts that they rotate out.
Upstairs in one of the most beautifully crafted libraries in the world, dating back to the 18th century, is the Long Room.
The Long Room houses 200,000 of the Library’s oldest books in its oak bookcases.

IntroductionOne of the great masterpieces in the History of Irish art, and a world-famous example of early Christian art, the Book of Kells (Leabhar Cheanannais) is the most famous of the illuminated manuscripts, produced by Irish monks about 800 CE.
Also known as the Book of Columba, or the Gospel of Colum Cille, the Book of Kells includes the four Gospels of the New Testament written in Latin, decorated with innumerable illuminations, illustrations and miniature images in a blaze of colour.
Although unfinished, it is a wonderful example of medieval Christian art and one of the best surviving examples of the Hiberno-Saxon style or Insular art.
It is on permanent display at Trinity College Dublin Library in Ireland.
When was the Book of Kells written, where was it written, and who was the author of the manuscript?
These questions remain the subject of considerable debate among scholars of monastic Irish art, and there are a number of theories.
According to the most widely accepted explanation, the Book of Kells was created at the monastery in Iona, and illuminated by at least four different artist-monks, whose names are lost to history.
Other art scholars have suggested that the manuscript may have been produced at Lindisfarne (Holy Island) off the coast of Northumberland, then moved to Iona and thence to Kells.
Or lastly, it may have been produced at an unidentified Scottish monastery.
Origins and History of the Book of Kells The greatest achievement of Irish medieval art, the Book of Kells, was formerly held to be earlier than the Lindisfarne Gospels (which are dated approximately from 700 CE) but is now generally assigned to the late eighth or early ninth century.
It can only have been made in one of two places: Iona or Kells.
It seems probable, though, that due to its resemblances to the Lindisfarne Gospels it was at least begun at Iona (a traditional centre of holy learning and illumination, from where Saint Columba launched his mission to Christianize Scotland and where he was later buried), the base from which Lindisfarne had been colonized about the year 635.
In 804, after two Viking raids, the monks of Iona fled from their exposed island monastery to Meath, in Ireland.
They obtained a grant of land at Cenannus (Kells) and established there the metropolis of the Columban Order.
Finally in 849 all were brought back to Kells, the great manuscript probably with them.
And as it is hardly probable that such a work should have been begun during the troubled years between 804 and 849 (and since most of its decorative art points to a date within the eighth century)
it is reasonable to assume that an important part of it had been produced in the scriptorium of Iona before the Viking raids drove the monks to Meath.
In any case the most probable date of the Book of Kells is between 760-804 and 815-20; and it is likely that different painters were working at it for several years.
In 1007, it was seized by Vikings who plundered its jewelled cover.
After the surrender of the monastery of Kells to the Crown by Abbot Richard Plunket in 1539, the manuscript passed into the hands of one Geralde Plunket of Dublin, possibly a relative of the abbot, and from Plunket to James Ussher; a highly versatile and accomplished scholar of the day, and one of the earliest students of Trinity College, Dublin.
Finally the manuscript passed with Ussher's library to Trinity College, where it is today.
This was supposed to be because, the book was written and illuminated during the time of Saint Columba (Saint Columcille) (c.521-97), perhaps even by Columba himself.
However, when it is said that the Book of Kells may have been written by Columba it is not meant that he was also the artist from whose pen the elaborate ornamentation of the volume proceeded.
Columba was reputed to have been a most industrious, indeed almost fanatical, scribe.
The illuminations were frequently executed much later than the manuscript itself and the original plan of the Book of Kells was apparently so vast that it could not be completed in a short time.
The spaces to be decorated were left blank by the scribe.
Several painters, possibly at different periods, were employed to fill them; there are, indeed, still to be seen some pages where the ornaments of the framework are unfinished, being only partially sketched in outline.
Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that Columba even wrote the script, since paleographic research shows that the style of Latin script used did not emerge until well after his death.
In response, some experts in Irish Art consider it may have been created in 797, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Saint Columba's death.
One artist, she feels, was obviously entrusted with the cruciform cover page known as "the page of the eight circles", the great Chi-Rho, and the initial page of each of the gospels, except the Quoniam.
The delicacy of his work is impressive, as is his interest in asymmetry.
Francoise Henry recognizes another individualist in the portraitist of the three Evangelists, the page composed of square frames, and the Quoniam at the beginning of the Gospel of Saint Luke.
The third is the "illustrator", the author of the Virgin and Child, the Tunc Crucifixerat, and the Temptation.

How the Book of Kells Compares With Other Manuscripts The script employed in the Book of Kells is the beautiful round uncial of all the best Irish manuscripts.
The scale of the Book of Kells is different from that of the Book of Durrow, and the mood of its expression is vastly different: the calm, meticulous distinction of the earlier book gives way to a flamboyant, magnificent exuberance; there is nothing of that constrained perfection of order and organization - inherited from the Cathach of Saint Columba (c.610-20) - which mark both the Book of Durrow and the Lindisfarne Gospels.
No manuscript we have seen before approaches the Book of Kells for elaborate ornamentation.
Each of the Gospels was prefaced with three pages of full-length decoration - a depiction of the Evangelists' symbol, a portrait of the Evangelist himself, and an Initial Page.
In addition, there were extra pages of decoration at two key passages in the text, the incarnation of Christ and the Crucifixion.
Last and most unusual of all, a series of narrative illustrations were planned, three of which have survived.
In addition, the cover pages have a cruciform composition, followed by a series of porticos framing the Canon Tables.
The Chi-Rho introducing the Genealogy of Christ in Saint Matthew is ornamented as richly as the initial pages of the gospels.
A continuous chain of ornamentation runs through the text.
In addition, one of the most striking and unusual features of the Book of Kells is this profusion of animated capitals, a feature of Irish illumination which may owe its origin to the ornamented letters ending in coiled Celtic spirals in the Book of Durrow.
Eastern Influence on the Design of the Book of Kells Oriental and particularly Coptic influence is generally recognized throughout the Book of Kells - Coptic clearly in the group of red dots on the robes of the Evangelists Mark and John.
Furthermore, the figure of the Virgin and Child seated on a throne surrounded by attending angels appears frequently in Coptic art.
Francoise Henry points out a striking analogy between the the Virgin and Child page and a ninth-century Coptic manuscript in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York (Catalogue of the Manuscripts of the Pierpont Morgan Collection).
But Coptic manuscripts of the ninth to the fourteenth centuries were evidently based on a well-established ancient tradition originating in the sixth (or even the fifth) century.
This assumption is supported by an early Coptic binding with a decorative arrangement of broad ribbons and crosses which suggest the existence in the sixth century of full pages of ribbon interlacing.
The later Coptic manuscripts which we know probably embody many archaic elements.
Illuminations in the Book of Kells For all the wealth and variety Irish manuscript illumination has to offer, it is the Book of Kells that is generally recognized as the supreme achievement in this field.
Symbols of the Evangelists The emphasis placed on the Evangelists' symbols was unprecedented.
In addition to the traditional symbol pages at the start of the Gospels, they featured in the Canon Tables, the portraits and other prefatory sections.
They were also used in a number of different ways - sometimes as ornamental motifs, sometimes as heraldic beasts, and sometimes as potent talismans.
In one instance, a peacock's tail becomes attached to a lion's head while, in another, the eagle of St John holds the Gospel in a human hand.
Only two of the portraits have survived, providing one of the weaker aspects of the decoration, but the four Initial Pages are superb.
It also offers the artist an opportunity to exercise his imagination to the full.
On the St John's page, for example, the letters 'c' and 'i' are transformed into a man playing a harp while, on the St Luke's page, the characters 'iam' merge together to become an instrument of torture.
Monogram Page (Chi-Ro) and Others The decoration on the pages which mark the incarnation of Christ is even more spectacular.
Hidden away among the loops and spirals, there are vignettes of cats and mice fighting over a communion wafer, an otter clutching a fish, and a row of angels displaying the Gospels.
In most other manuscripts, the Monogram Page provides the sole decoration at this point but, in the Book of Kells, the incarnation passage is commemorated with two other illustrations.
There is a splendid Carpet Page - the only one in the Kells' manuscript - and a portrait of Christ.
The latter was a great rarity in Insular manuscripts, as was the notion of adding decoration to the Crucifixion passage.
Sadly, this is one of the sections of the book that was never completed.
There is an ornamental Initial Page, but this faces a blank sheet where, doubtless, a depiction of the Crucifixion was planned.
The narrative illustrations hint at a new 'figurative' direction in Celtic art.
With their preference for abstract or stylized forms, Celtic craftsmen usually shied away from themes of this kind and only a few, isolated examples can be found in the earlier Gospel Books.
Here, there are three, and it seems likely that the complete manuscript would have included several more.
The surviving illustrations depict the Temptation of Christ, the Arrest, and the Virgin and Child.
Celtic Style Designwork
For the origins and history of Celtic Designs, the evolution of motifs such as Celtic Interlace Designs, zoomorphic patterns and symbols including Celtic Knots and Celtic Crosses, all part of the heritage of the Ancient Celts, see Celtic Culture.
And both share those peculiar characteristics that set them apart from the illuminated work of other cultures and other areas, and which curiously relate them in spirit to the visual approach and the visual appetites of the exploring artists of the present period in the twentieth century - a thousand years and more since the dates of their production.
Other Irish Illuminated Gospel Books The Book of Kells is one of a number of illuminated books created by Irish artists in monastries in Ireland, Scotland and England.
These illustrated texts, with their covers richly ornamented with precious metalwork, comprise the foremost examples of early Christian art.

The Terror of Gothic Castles: How Gothic Novels and Gothic Architecture Created Truly Spooky Places Gothic castles have occupied a place in people's imaginations for hundreds of years.
However, there's some confusion about what the word actually means.'
Gothic' is an amalgamation of two different ideas from different times in history.
Originally, gothic referred to a style of architecture that was popular in the middle of Medieval times (mid middle-ages).
It was a style of architecture which was famed for grand arched buildings with sweeping windows.
Many cathedrals in Europe are 'gothic', and Malbork Castle is an example of gothic architecture.
In the 1700s, gothic acquired a new meaning.
There was a trend for a new genre of writing - 'gothic' novels.
These were a precursor for the horror stories of today.
Hunyad Castle is an example of a spooky, gothic castle.
Gothic is taken to mean an architectural style as well as an atmosphere - of spooky, fearful, desolate and ruined old places.
Eeeek!

Gothic Castle Architecture - Sweeping Designs For Mid-Medieval Times Before Gothic Architecture came along, castles of early Medieval times were cold, dark and damp.
Worse still, the castles were often liable to attack - square towers could easily be toppled when attackers burrowed beneath just one of the corners.
Gothic architecture was a mid-Medieval movement that revolutionised the way that buildings were built.
A new technological development - the flying buttress - meant that it was possible to build taller, wider and grander buildings.
These flying buttresses are a feature of gothic architecture.

The ceilings in gothic buildings were made of up grand, pointed arches, which created an interesting, vaulted effect.
Improvements in building skill, and the manipulation of stone, meant that gothic styles could be more beautiful and elaborate than previous designs.
These was made possible by the developments above, and ushered in a new age of design, which was dramatically different from the claustrophobic old castles of before.
I've written another page on the characteristics of gothic architecture, if you're keen to find out more.
The gothic architecture movement originated in France, and spread across Europe.
It was reasonably influential in England and Wales, but gothic architecture really flourished within Eastern Europe.
The vaulted arches are typical of gothic architecture; and the spooky surroundings have been featured in gothic novels and poetry.

However, some castles began to be built in the gothic fashion - Malbork Castle in Poland being the most obvious example.
Evidently, these light, airy and sophisticated gothic designs were a vast step-up from the dark, dank old stone castles of yore.
Fundamentally, gothic architecture really marked a renaissance in castle design.
The skills to build more complex and sophisticated buildings - such as round towers - made castles harder to attack.
Round towers had no corners for attackers to burrow beneath, and topple the castle!
Castles as a place of fear and terror: Gothic Castles and the Gothic Novel Dark, secret passageways are a common feature of gothic novels.

Novelist Horace Walpole had written a new type of book altogether, creating a new genre of fiction.
His novel was called "The Castle of Oranto", and it made a splash as the first gothic novel.
Gothic novels were written to elicit strong emotions - they set out to intrigue and to terrify readers in equal measure!
The novels were written to conjure up images of mysterious, decaying old buildings where dark secrets had laid hidden for hundreds of years.
Often, these novels were set in the ruins of old castles.
They described castles as being filled with memories of life gone by; and marked by death.
This meant that castles were often used as a setting in gothic novels.

Gothic novels featured elements of mystery; of romance; of ghosts; of monsters (Frankenstein started life as a gothic novel!) ; of murders; and of vampires - such as the figure of Dracula.
As a result of the influence of the gothic novel, people's imaginations began to conjure up pictures of 'gothic castles'.
The public began to imagine castles to be deserted places of hauntings, murders, mystery and intrigue.
People envisaged castles to be filled with secret passages, terrible old mysteries, and even to be filled with vampires and fearful creatures (see more on Hunyad castle, just below!)
Fundamentally, gothic fiction created an image of spooky, deserted and menacing old castles.
This image lives on in people's minds to today - and it's certainly evoked many powerful emotions over the years.

Parts of the castle exterior are decorated with over-ornate gothic detail (see the picture just below), and the innards are filled with vaulted-ceilings over vast, echoing halls.
The gothic looks of Hunyad Castle are a little bit too perfect!
This castle has been ravaged by fire on numerous occasions, and restorations in the 1800s and 1900s over-exaggerated the gothic style on the outside of the building.

In the 1500s, the old tale goes, three prisoners from Turkey were promised their freedom if they could dig down far enough in the courtyard to find water.
Terribly, the legend goes, they it captors turned on their word.
The prisoners were never freed despite toiling to build the old castle well.

The crimson exterior of the castle is unmistakably gothic in design.
However, it's the staggering internal gothic detail which elevates Malbork above all other gothic castles.
Malbork is a wonder of the Medieval world which has miraculously survived until today.
The complex was built between 1276 and 1406 by the Teutonic Knights, an order of Catholic adherents involved in the crusades of the Middle Ages.
The perfect vaulted arches within Malbork Castle are a beautiful example of gothic castles architecture.

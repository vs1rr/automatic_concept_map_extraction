The Hall Christ Church College Oxford, England.
The Hall is a vestige of the main room in castles and other great medieval buildings (such as Westminster Hall).
All traditional Oxford and Cambridge Colleges have them - the colleges have retained the tradition of everyone eating together, as have the Inns of Court and many public (ie private) schools.
Such halls are often now called Great Halls or Dining Halls since the idea of a hall has changed to no more than an entrance or vestibule.
("Refectories" are for monasteries and aspirational modern institutions)
The tables here have individual seats rather than the traditional benches.
Until recently, before Health and Safety moved in, it was normal practice for undergraduates to walk over the tables to get to their benches on the other side of thetable.
Christ Church College is usually called just Christ Church, or for those in the know "The House".
It was originally called Cardinal's College after its founder Cardinal Wolsey.
The hall here was used as a model for the hall at Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films.
It is shown here as it would have looked before falling into ruin.
In the mid-1990s, the keep was restored, The building is one of South Yorkshire's primary tourist attractions.

Dunster Castle is a former motte and bailey castle, now a country house, sited on top of a Tor.
The site has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period.
A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy.
At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century.
The castle was expanded several times by the Luttrell family during the 17th and 18th centuries; they built a large manor house within the Lower Ward of the castle in 1617.
The medieval castle walls were mostly destroyed following the siege of Dunster Castle at the end of the English Civil War, when Parliament ordered the defences to be slighted to prevent their further use.
In 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most of its contents to the National Trust, which now operates it as a tourist attraction.
It is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.
The hall was built by Sir Thomas Burgh in 1460.
In 1484 Sir Thomas entertained King Richard III in his hall.
King Henry VIII visited Gainsborough twice; once in 1509 and again in 1541 with the doomed Queen Catherine Howard.
The Old Hall has changed very little over the years.
On the north east corner is a brick tower.
The Hall with its elaborate timber roof survives as well as the kitchen—possibly the most complete medieval kitchen in England.
The kitchen still contains many original features, including two open fireplaces, each large enough to roast an ox, and two bread ovens served by a third chimney.
The Hall is now owned by English Heritage and is open to the public as a museum.
It is listed as Grade I for Heritage Protection.

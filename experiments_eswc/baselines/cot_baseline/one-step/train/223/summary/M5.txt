Constantine the Great divided the Roman Empire and made Christianity the dominant religion. The Visigoths, led by Alaric, sacked Rome in 410 C.E., marking the first of many invasions. Constantine's acceptance of Christianity weakened Roman traditions and authority. He split the empire into two parts, with the eastern half thriving while the western half declined. Economic issues, trade deficits, and military problems also contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire. Germanic tribes like the Visigoths, Vandals, and Franks further weakened the Empire, leading to its eventual collapse in the west in 476 C.E.

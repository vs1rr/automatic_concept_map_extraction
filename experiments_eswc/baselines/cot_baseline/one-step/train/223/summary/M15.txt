The Battle of Manzikert in 1071 between the Byzantine Empire and Seljuk Turkish forces led by Alp Arslan resulted in the defeat of the Byzantine Empire and the capture of Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes. The battle was preceded by years of conflict and diplomatic maneuvers, with Romanus leading expeditions against the Seljuks. The Byzantine army, accompanied by various mercenaries and allies, faced challenges during their march across Asia Minor, including internal conflicts and desertions. The actual battle took place near Manzikert, where the Byzantines suffered a significant defeat due to miscommunications and betrayal within their ranks. Romanus was captured and treated with kindness by Alp Arslan, but upon his return, he faced betrayal and a gruesome fate at the hands of his own subjects. Despite relatively low casualties, the defeat at Manzikert marked the beginning of the decline of the Byzantine Empire, leading to further losses of territory to the Seljuks in the following decades. The battle is considered a turning point in Byzantine history, contributing to the empire's eventual downfall and impacting the geopolitical landscape of the region, ultimately influencing the later Crusades.

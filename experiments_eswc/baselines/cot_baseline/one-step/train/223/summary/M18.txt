The Byzantine Empire, a continuation of the Roman Empire, thrived for over a thousand years until its fall in 1453. Initially part of the Roman Empire, it evolved into a predominantly Greek-speaking entity with its capital in Constantinople. The empire was a powerful force in Europe, known for its economic, cultural, and military strength. Key events, such as the division of the Roman Empire by Diocletian, the shift of the capital to Constantinople by Constantine I, and the adoption of Greek as the official language under Heraclius, marked its transition. The empire reached its peak under Justinian I, expanding its territories significantly. However, it faced challenges such as territorial losses during the Muslim conquests and the Fourth Crusade's devastating impact. The term "Byzantine Empire" was coined later, with a derogatory connotation, but modern studies highlight its positive contributions to European civilization. The Byzantine legacy includes the preservation of classical knowledge, shaping Orthodoxy, and influencing the Renaissance and Slav Orthodox culture. The empire's fall in 1453 to the Ottoman Turks marked the end of an era, with the Ottomans considering themselves heirs to Byzantium and preserving aspects of its tradition. The Byzantine Empire's impact on Europe and the East was profound, shaping the course of history for centuries to come.

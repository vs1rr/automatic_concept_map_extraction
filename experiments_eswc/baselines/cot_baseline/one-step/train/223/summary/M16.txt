The Byzantines, a bridge between the Classical and Post-Classical era, thrived from 330 C.E. when Constantine moved his capital to Byzantium, later named Constantinople. Known for their religious buildings and art, the Byzantines' masterpiece was Justinian's Hagia Sophia. They were a dominant economic force until the Turks conquered Istanbul in 1453. The Turks, with a history dating back to 2,000 B.C.E., settled in Anatolia after the Malazgirt victory in 1071. The Anatolian Seljuk State, part of the Great Seljuk Empire, flourished with monumental structures and cultural figures like Rumi. The collapse of the Seljuk Empire led to the rise of the Ottoman Empire, which captured Constantinople in 1453, ending the Byzantine reign.

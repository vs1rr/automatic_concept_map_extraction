The Byzantine Empire, a Greek-speaking continuation of the Roman Empire, thrived for over a thousand years until its fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Initially part of the Roman Empire, it transitioned to focus on Greek culture and Orthodox Christianity. The empire experienced periods of expansion and decline, reaching its peak under Justinian I. However, attacks by various invaders and internal conflicts led to its gradual decline, culminating in the Fall of Constantinople. The empire's history is marked by significant events such as the split between east and west, the reign of Justinian I, the rise of Islam, the Iconoclasm movement, and the Crusades. Despite efforts to revive its power, the Byzantine Empire ultimately succumbed to the Ottomans in 1453, marking the end of an era.

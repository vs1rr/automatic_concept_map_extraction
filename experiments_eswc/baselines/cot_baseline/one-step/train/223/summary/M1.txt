The Byzantine Empire, originating in 330 A.D. when Constantine I established Constantinople as a new Roman capital, survived for 1,000 years after the fall of the western Roman Empire. With a rich tradition of art, literature, and learning, the empire served as a military buffer between Europe and Asia. Despite facing various threats, including attacks by Germanic tribes and later by Islamic forces, the Byzantine Empire thrived under rulers like Justinian I and the Macedonian dynasty. The empire's legacy includes its influence on the Western intellectual tradition, as seen during the Italian Renaissance, and its lasting impact on countries practicing Orthodox Christianity. The empire finally fell in 1453 when Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, marking the end of an era but leaving a lasting cultural legacy.

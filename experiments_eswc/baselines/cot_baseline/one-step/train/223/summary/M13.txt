The Byzantine-Sassanid War (602-628) was a significant conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires. It began with Khosrau II's invasion of Byzantine land in 602, seeking revenge for the death of his ally, Emperor Maurice. The war saw early successes for the Sassanids, with rebellions breaking out in the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Heraclius eventually took charge, building a new army and leading successful campaigns against the Sassanids. Despite facing challenges from other enemies, Heraclius managed to defeat the Sassanids and secure peace. The war ended with Khosrau II being overthrown, and Heraclius returning to Constantinople in triumph.

The Byzantine Empire, formed after the split of the Roman Empire, thrived for 1000 years ruling Eastern and Southern Europe. Emperor Constantine I established Constantinople as the capital and embraced Christianity. The peak of the empire was during the Justinian Dynasty, with Emperor Justinian I expanding territory and implementing reforms, including the famous Justinian Code. The empire split from the Catholic Church in 1054 and engaged in wars against Muslims. In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire. Constantinople, known as Istanbul today, was a center of art, culture, and power for centuries.

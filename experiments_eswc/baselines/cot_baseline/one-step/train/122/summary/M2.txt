Bruce Castle, also known as Lordship House, is a manor house in Tottenham, London, with a rich history and even a resident ghost. Despite its grand name, the origins of the house are linked to the English monarchy rather than Scotland's Robert the Bruce. The structure has undergone various renovations over the centuries, with the Tudor Tower being a notable feature. The house changed hands frequently, with owners like Hugh Hare, who renamed it Bruce Castle to elevate his social status. The house was later converted into a progressive school by Sir Rowland Hill, who introduced the world's first postage stamp. Today, Bruce Castle serves as a museum open to the public.

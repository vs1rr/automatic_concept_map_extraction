Bruce Castle Museum, Archives, and Park in Tottenham is a Grade 1 listed building with a rich history dating back to the 16th century. Originally owned by Sir William Compton, it was later modified by various owners, including Rowland Hill, the inventor of the penny post. Saved from development in the 19th century, the building opened as a museum in 1906, showcasing the history of the London Borough of Haringey. The park, Haringey's oldest, offers a glimpse into the estate's past with its Great Oak tree and recreational activities for residents. The museum hosts educational programs, family activities, exhibitions, and local history talks, making it a vibrant hub for the community.

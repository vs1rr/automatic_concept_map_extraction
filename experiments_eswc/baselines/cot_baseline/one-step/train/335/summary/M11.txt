In 1612, ten people were convicted of witchcraft in Lancaster and hanged on the moors above the town. The accused, including two men and an elderly woman, were believed to have committed various acts of witchcraft, such as laming and causing madness. The story of the Pendle Witches began in the remote Pendle Forest, where Alison Device's encounter with a peddler led to a series of accusations and arrests. The trials revealed shocking testimonies and resulted in multiple convictions, with the accused facing charges of murder and witchcraft. The trials, documented in "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster," shed light on the political and religious tensions of the time, ultimately leading to the execution of the accused individuals.

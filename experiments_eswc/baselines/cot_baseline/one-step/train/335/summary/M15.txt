The Pendle witches were at the center of a notorious witch trial in the 17th century, where twelve people were accused of witchcraft in Lancaster. The trial, well-documented in "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster," led to the execution of ten individuals. The background of the trials involved rival families, poverty-stricken widows, and a society fascinated by witchcraft. King James I's interest in witchcraft influenced the unrest and fear surrounding the trials. The accusations stemmed from a feud between families and escalated with wild claims of witchcraft. The trials, held in 1612, were marked by unusual circumstances and extreme accusations, making them a significant event in the history of witch trials in England.

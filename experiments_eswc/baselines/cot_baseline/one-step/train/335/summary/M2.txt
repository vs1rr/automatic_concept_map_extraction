A statue of Alice Nutter, one of the Pendle witches accused of murder by witchcraft in 1612, will be placed in Roughlee to commemorate the 400th anniversary of her death. The statue, yet to be designed, will sit on Blacko Bar Road and must celebrate her unfairly treated status and represent the year 1612. The project aims to move away from her witch image and highlight her wrongful conviction. Alice Nutter, perceived differently from the other accused witches due to her wealth and silence during trial, was executed in 1612. The statue is expected to be completed by April 2012.

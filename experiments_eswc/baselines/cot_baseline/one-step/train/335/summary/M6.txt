The Pendle Witch Trials in England from 1612 to 1634 were part of the Lancashire Witch Trials and are well-documented. The accused were from the Pendle Hill area, known for witchcraft. Accusations spread to multiple families, resulting in twelve people being charged with witchcraft and murder. Most were found guilty and executed, with one acquitted. The trials were influenced by King James' views on witchcraft. A later trial in 1633-1634 saw more accused, including Margaret Johnson, who confessed but was later found innocent. The trials inspired plays and continue to be associated with Pendle's tourism.

The Pendle Witch trials began on 18th August 1612, involving nine Lancashire women and two men accused of murders. Out of the twelve charged, one was found not guilty, one died in prison, and the remaining ten were executed by hanging. The trials are well-documented in British history, notably through Thomas Potts' published account. Interestingly, many defendants identified as witches or healers practicing 'magic' for payment. The trials were significant due to their scale, with the Pendle witches representing 2% of all British witches tried for witchcraft during the period.

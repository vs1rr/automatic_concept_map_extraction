The text discusses the concerns surrounding the 'CSI effect' in legal decisions influenced by popular crime television shows like Crime Scene Investigations (CSI). While some positive impacts of increased awareness of forensic evidence are noted, there are concerns about unrealistic expectations and misplaced trust in forensic science among jurors.

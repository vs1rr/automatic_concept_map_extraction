The CSI Effect is a phenomenon where law enforcement and prosecutors believe that forensic science TV shows like CSI influence jurors to expect more forensic evidence in trials. While professionals worry about unrealistic expectations set by these shows, empirical research has not conclusively proven the CSI Effect's impact on jury decisions. Some studies suggest that viewers of CSI have higher expectations for scientific evidence but this doesn't necessarily affect their willingness to convict. Instead, there seems to be more of a "tech effect" where jurors are influenced by technological advancements in their own lives. Despite concerns, the popularity of forensic science TV dramas has led to an increase in universities offering forensic science degrees and students pursuing them.

The CSI effect refers to the exaggerated portrayal of forensic science on TV shows, leading to unrealistic public perceptions. It influences public perception by distorting what crime scene investigators and forensic scientists do, depicting technologies that do not exist, creating unrealistic expectations for evidence collection and analysis, and presenting outcomes much faster than reality. This effect is important as public expectations may impact jury trials, leading to jurors expecting more forensic evidence than necessary and having excessive confidence in forensic and DNA evidence. As a result, jurors are increasingly acquitting defendants due to the lack of specific evidence. The CSI effect has prompted changes in legal preparation for prosecutors, who now address the limitations of forensic science, and in jury selection, with a focus on potential jurors' TV preferences. Defense attorneys have new strategies to create doubt in jurors' minds, while potential criminals have become more educated about forensic evidence.

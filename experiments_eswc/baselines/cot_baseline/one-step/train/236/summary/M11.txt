Brazil's history is marked by colonization by the Portuguese, leading to the establishment of a plantation colony with African slaves. Independence was declared in 1822, with Pedro I becoming emperor. The empire saw political stability and economic growth until the military coup in 1889 established the republic. Brazil's involvement in wars and political changes shaped its history, including a period of dictatorship. The economy diversified in the 20th century, with Brazil becoming one of the BRIC countries. Postal history in Brazil includes early stamp issues and special stamps from airlines like ETA, Condor, and VARIG. Zeppelin mail also played a significant role in Brazil's postal history, with special flights and stamps issued by Luftschiffbau Zeppelin.

Brazil declared independence from Portugal on September 7, 1822, with Dom Pedro I proclaiming freedom in the "Grito de Ipiranga." This marked the beginning of the Brazilian Empire, ending centuries of Portuguese colonial rule. Unlike other Latin American countries that fought for independence, Brazil's transition was peaceful, with Portugal offering no resistance. The move towards independence was influenced by historical events, including the relocation of the Portuguese court to Rio de Janeiro during Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. Despite the heroic portrayal of the declaration, it is noted that Pedro I was reportedly suffering from diarrhea at the time. Brazil's unique path to independence resulted in it becoming the only monarchy in Latin America post-independence.

Brazil was under Portuguese rule for 81 years, first as part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves, and later as the independent Empire of Brazil. The Portuguese court moved to Rio de Janeiro to escape Napoleon's troops, leading to Brazil's elevation from a colony to a kingdom. When the king wanted to return to Europe, Brazilians chose to remain independent. The royal family, the Orleans-Braganza, had to decide between declaring Brazil's independence or facing a Republican revolution. The Orleans-Braganza branch in Portugal has been more royalist, but this loyalty may be shifting.

Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, was an English diplomat known for his vote against condemning Mary, Queen of Scots, and for a stag-hunt mishap involving the Archbishop of Canterbury. He had a tumultuous personal life, marrying twice and abandoning his first wife. Zouche held various prestigious positions, including Ambassador to Scotland and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He had interests in the New World and horticulture. Zouche's death in 1625 led to a succession dispute within his family. Additionally, he played a role in sending four children to America on the Mayflower.

Bramshill House, a Jacobean-style building constructed in the early 17th century, now serves as a police staff training college. The house features symmetrical elevations, a narrow interior court, and red brick construction with stone details. It became the principal police training college in the UK in 1960 and later housed part of the National Policing Improvement Agency. Currently undergoing a refurbishment, the project is set to be completed by 2014.

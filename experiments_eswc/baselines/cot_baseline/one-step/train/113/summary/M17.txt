The Borobudur Temple Compounds in central Java, Indonesia, is a significant Buddhist monument built in the 8th and 9th centuries. The temple's structure symbolizes Buddhist cosmology, with three tiers representing different spheres of existence. The site includes the main Borobudur Temple and two smaller temples, each representing phases in attaining Nirvana. The temple's authenticity has been maintained through restoration efforts. However, threats such as development, tourism pressure, and natural disasters like volcanic eruptions require ongoing protection and management. The property is managed under Indonesian cultural heritage laws, with efforts to ensure its conservation and sustainable tourism.

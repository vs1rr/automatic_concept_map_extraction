Indonesian police have heightened security at the Borobudur Temple, the world's largest Buddhist temple, following a threat made by Islamic State supporters on Facebook. The threat, posted on August 15, warned of the temple's destruction by Islamic militants. Security measures include increased personnel and cooperation with the Indonesian Military to safeguard the UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is not the first time the temple has been targeted, as it was previously bombed in 1985.

“Wow! An impressive temple”5 of 5 stars Reviewed 6 days ago NEWThis amazing temple is one of must-see tourist attractions in Java.
It takes around 1 hour transfer from Yogjakarta city.
This huge monument is located in a green valley and consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome.
Amazing decoration with more than 2000 relief panels and hundreds of Buddha statues.
Although many reliefs and statues have been destroyed because of earth quakes and time, the site remains its endless charm.

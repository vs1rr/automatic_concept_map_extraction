The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 were influential statements passed by the state legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia, written by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison respectively. They opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, introduced the theory of nullification, and were rejected by other states. Despite their rejection, the Resolutions became central to Jefferson's party and influenced the concept of states' rights, later being used to justify South Carolina's nullification of federal laws and influencing Southern secession in the 1860s. The Resolutions were ultimately rejected during the Civil War and did not resurface afterwards.

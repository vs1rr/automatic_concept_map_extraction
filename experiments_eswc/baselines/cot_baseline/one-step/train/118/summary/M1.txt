Brougham Castle, located next to the River Eamont on the site of an old Roman fort, has a rich history dating back to the early 13th century. Initially built by Robert de Vipont, the castle saw significant enhancements by Robert Clifford, who added a new gatehouse complex, domestic buildings, and a stone curtain wall. Despite being captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388, the castle was later restored by Lady Anne Clifford. Today, Brougham Castle is open to the public and managed by English Heritage.

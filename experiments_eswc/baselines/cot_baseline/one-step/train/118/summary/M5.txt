A 13th-century castle, originally built by Robert de Vieuxpont on the site of a former Roman fort known as Brocavum, played a significant role in various historical events, including wars with Scotland and the War of the Roses. The castle saw periods of decline and renovation, with Lady Anne Clifford restoring it in the 17th century. Eventually falling into ruin, the castle inspired William Wordsworth's poem 'The Prelude'. In 1928, the government took ownership, and since 1984, English Heritage has been preserving the site, which is now open to visitors during the summer months.

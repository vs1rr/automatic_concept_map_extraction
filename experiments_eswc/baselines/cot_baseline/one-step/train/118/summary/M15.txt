Brougham Castle, originally a Roman fort site, was later taken over by the Norman family of Vieuxpont to build their castle. The current castle, founded by Hugh de Morville, saw various ownership changes and periods of decay. Lady Anne Clifford's restoration work in the 17th century brought the castle back to life, but it fell into ruin after her death. The castle, overlooking the River Eamont, is now an English Heritage site open to visitors.

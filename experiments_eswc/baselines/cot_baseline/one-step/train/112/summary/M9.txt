The Book of Kells is a significant relic with 678 illustrated pages made of calf-skin or vellum, colored with natural dyes by monks. The symbols in the book, often misunderstood as representing the Apostles, actually symbolize the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The Irish people are believed to be descendants of the Tribe of Dan, who migrated to Ireland under various names. The Book of Kells also references the four tribal standards mentioned in the Apocalypse/Revelation, linking them to the tribes of Israel. The emblems in the book are seen as a representation of the tribes to whom the Gospels were to be preached, aligning with the belief that the Irish are descendants of Israelites.

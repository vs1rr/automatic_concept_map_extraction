The Book of Kells, a famous illuminated manuscript also known as the Book of Columba, was created by Celtic monks around AD 800 in the style of Insular art. Despite debates about its origin, it is believed to have been produced by Columban monks associated with the community at Iona. The manuscript contains the four gospels written in colorful inks and intricate artwork. While the exact production location remains uncertain, the prevailing theory suggests it was started at Iona and finished at Kells. The book, though unfinished, showcases a lavish illumination program with intricate decorations and full-page illustrations. Despite its age, the Book of Kells remains in remarkably good condition and is a testament to the skill and dedication of its creators.

Pembroke Castle, with its humble beginnings in 1093, has a rich history filled with architectural marvels and strategic defenses. The castle's main features include a cylindrical tower with a stone dome, circular rooms, and a gatehouse with multiple portcullises. Notably, it is the birthplace of Henry VII and played a role in the conflicts of King Charles I's reign. Today, Pembroke Castle is owned by a Private Charitable Trust and offers visitors an immersive experience through exhibitions and tableaux depicting its historical moments.

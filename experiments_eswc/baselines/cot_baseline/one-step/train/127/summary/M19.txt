Alton Castle, built in 1170, overlooks the Churnet Valley and is protected by a cliff, rock-cut ditch, and curtain wall. The remaining walls and gatehouse date back to the late 12th and early 13th centuries. After being slighted in the Civil War, a new residence, Alton Towers, was built in the 18th century. In the 19th century, a new mock castle was constructed nearby. Located on Castle Hill Rd, Alton, Stoke-on-Trent ST10 4TT, it can be reached via the B5032, 7 miles north of Uttoxeter.

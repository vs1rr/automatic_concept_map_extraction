Castles were constructed during the Middle Ages to serve as fortified residences for kings and nobility, who needed protection in a time when Europe was divided among lords and princes. These structures were initially made of wood and later replaced with stone for increased strength. Castles were strategically built on hills or near natural features to aid in defense. Common castle features included moats, keeps, curtain walls, arrow slits, gatehouses, and battlements. Famous castles like Windsor Castle, Tower of London, and Leeds Castle have rich histories. Fun facts include the evolution of tower shapes for better defense, the use of siege engines in attacks, and the presence of cats and dogs in castles to control pests.

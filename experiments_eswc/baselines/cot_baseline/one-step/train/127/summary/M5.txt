Castles were built in Europe during Medieval times as fortified structures to defend against foreign invaders, symbolize power, and serve as residences for lords and their families. They emerged in the 11th century, initially made of wood and later of stone for increased fortification. Castles were ruled by lords or nobles and were heavily guarded, with the keep being the strongest and safest part. They provided a strategic advantage in wars, with moats and guards playing crucial roles in defense. Castles differed from palaces in their fortified nature, while moats served as defensive barriers. Castles were essential for protection and symbolized the power of the ruling elite.

Castles have taken on various forms over the centuries, from ancient hill forts to Renaissance country houses. Historians debate the definition of a castle, but generally agree it is a private fortified residence of a monarch or nobleman. The word "castle" comes from the Latin "castellum," meaning "fortified place." Castles served military, administrative, and domestic purposes, evolving in design and function over time. They were symbols of power and prestige, with aesthetics becoming increasingly important. As warfare evolved, castles lost their military significance and were eventually replaced by country houses. Castles originated in Europe in the 9th and 10th centuries, controlling surrounding areas and serving as both defensive and offensive structures. Castle architecture evolved with siege technology, and they were often built near vital resources. Permission to build castles was sometimes required from monarchs, with exceptions in certain regions. The decline of true castles began in the 16th century due to advancements in artillery, leading to the construction of artillery forts and country houses. Despite this, there was a revival of interest in castles in the 18th century for their architectural appeal.

Harewood Castle, the oldest building at Harewood, underwent a significant restoration project in 2004-2005, supported by English Heritage and the Harewood Estate. The castle, granted a 'license to crenellate' in 1366, was designed for both security and comfort, featuring defensive elements like a portcullis and arrow slit windows, as well as mullioned windows showcasing 14th-century craftsmanship. The castle's strategic location on a steep slope offered both security and status, overlooking Wharfedale. After passing through generations, the castle fell into disrepair by the 17th century, with its fate and reasons for abandonment remaining a mystery.

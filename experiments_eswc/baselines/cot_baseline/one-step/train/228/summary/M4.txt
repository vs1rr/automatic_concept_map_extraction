The Convention of 1833, held in San Felipe, Texas, aimed to address various issues including repealing anti-immigration laws, improving Indian defense, and proposing a constitution for Texas. Delegates, including Sam Houston, petitioned for statehood and presented a constitution inspired by the Massachusetts constitution of 1780. The convention adjourned on April 13, with Stephen F. Austin later traveling alone to Mexico to present the petitions to the government.

The Manhattan Project was a U.S. government research project from 1942 to 1945 that developed the first atomic bombs. American scientists, including refugees from Europe, organized the project to harness the fission process for military use. The project involved extensive research, development, and production of fissionable materials like uranium-235 and plutonium-239. The first successful nuclear explosion occurred in July 1945 in New Mexico, leading to the subsequent dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.

The Manhattan Project was a top-secret American initiative during WWII to build the first atomic bomb. It was launched after Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt about the Nazis' potential to create powerful atomic bombs. The project involved key figures like Oppenheimer, Groves, and Bush, and led to the testing and dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ultimately ending WWII. The project marked the beginning of the nuclear age and influenced the development of atomic weapons globally.

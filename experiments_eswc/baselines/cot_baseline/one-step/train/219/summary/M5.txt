The Manhattan Project during World War II was a top-secret U.S. initiative to develop the atomic bomb before Germany or Japan. Initiated by a warning from Albert Einstein, President Roosevelt organized a research committee leading to the creation of the project in June 1942. The project, carried out in secret scientific cities like Los Alamos, culminated in the detonation of the first atomic bomb at Trinity on July 16, 1945. The project produced three bombs, with "Little Boy" and "Fat Man" being dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively, leading to Japan's unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945. The Manhattan Project marked the beginning of the nuclear age and introduced the most destructive weapon known to mankind.

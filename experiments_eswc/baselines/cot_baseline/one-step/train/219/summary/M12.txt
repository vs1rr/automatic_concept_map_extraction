The Frischâ€“Peierls memorandum, written in 1940, outlined the calculations for the critical mass needed for an atomic bomb, leading to the acceleration of bomb development efforts during World War II. The document influenced the formation of the secret MAUD Committee and ultimately contributed to the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The memorandum proposed the development of such a weapon as a defense strategy and anticipated the deterrence policies of the Cold War. It described the destructive power and radioactive aftermath of a potential atomic bomb explosion.

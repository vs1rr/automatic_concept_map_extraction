The Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II. Led by the United States with support from the United Kingdom and Canada, the project began in 1939 and employed over 130,000 people, costing nearly $2 billion. The project developed two types of atomic bombs using uranium-235 and plutonium, with significant advancements in isotope separation methods. The timeline of the Manhattan Project includes key events from the initial stages in 1939 to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, until the project was officially replaced by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947.

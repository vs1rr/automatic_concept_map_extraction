The British Empire was known as "the empire on which the sun never sets" due to its vast reach. Motivations for British imperialism in India included gaining products for factories, spreading Christianity, increasing power globally, and a belief in their superiority. The British expanded their territory in India through a strong navy, advanced weaponry, and efficient organization. Before British rule, India was not a unified political entity but a collection of kingdoms.

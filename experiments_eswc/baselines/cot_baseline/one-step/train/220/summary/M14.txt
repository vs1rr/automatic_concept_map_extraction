The British Empire, once the largest state in history, covered a significant portion of the Earth's land area in the 1930s. The Order of the British Empire is a key symbol, honoring those who contributed to the UK's economy, culture, and sport. The basic range of British Empire tea includes a blend of Ceylon and Indian teas, offering a consistent, astringent taste with a rich aroma and a sweet, malty aftertaste. Best enjoyed with milk, the range features British Empire breakfast tea, Captain Woodget Ceylon tea, and Lord Grey black tea with bergamot.

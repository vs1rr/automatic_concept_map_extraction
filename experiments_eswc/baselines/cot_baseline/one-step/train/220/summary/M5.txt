Britain's victory over Napoleon in 1815 marked the end of a long global conflict, with fears of renewed war lingering. Despite domestic challenges, Britain emerged as a dominant imperial power, securing its position through military alliances and naval supremacy. Its empire included colonies in North America, South Africa, and the Caribbean, as well as a vast and complex presence in India. The expansion of the British Empire was driven by a mix of personal ambitions, commercial interests, and strategic concerns. The growth of this empire was not a result of a deliberate plan, but rather shaped by the uncertainties of global warfare and interactions with diverse societies.

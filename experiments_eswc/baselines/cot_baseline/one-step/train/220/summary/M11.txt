The British Empire was the largest empire in history, covering a quarter of the Earth's landmass and governing a fifth of the world's population. Starting in the 15th century, England's late entry into trans-oceanic exploration led to a focus on maritime strength, with Queen Elizabeth I marking the beginning of England's transition into an empire. The 17th century saw colonization efforts in North America and the Caribbean, while the 18th century brought naval supremacy and expansion in Africa and Asia. The 19th century saw the Royal Navy's global dominance and the abolition of slavery, leading to increased focus on Asia and Africa. The 20th century saw the empire's decline due to economic challenges and decolonization efforts, with the empire dismantled by the mid-20th century. The legacy of the British Empire includes the spread of the English language, parliamentary system, and common law, as well as significant demographic changes through migrations.

The British Empire, the largest empire in history, spanned a quarter of the world and made the United Kingdom the most powerful country for over a century. Starting in the 17th century and lasting until the mid-20th century, it included dominions, colonies, protectorates, and mandates. The empire's influence is still seen worldwide, with English being the most common international language. Despite challenges like the loss of American colonies, the British Empire expanded to Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Setbacks from the world wars led to decolonization, with India gaining independence in 1947 and African countries following in the 1960s. The empire's legacy is evident in the Commonwealth nations, with Queen Elizabeth II as the shared head of state for sixteen countries.

Ancient Egypt, a civilization that thrived for almost 30 centuries, captivated historians and archaeologists with its majestic pyramids, rich religious traditions, and beautiful art. The Predynastic Period saw the gradual development of Egyptian civilization, while the Archaic Period laid the foundations of society and kingship. The Old Kingdom was known for its pyramid builders and prosperity, followed by the turbulent First Intermediate Period. The Middle Kingdom flourished under aggressive foreign policy and pyramid-building, while the Second Intermediate Period was marked by division and foreign rule. The New Kingdom saw Egypt reunite, establish an empire, and feature powerful rulers like Hatshepsut and Akhenaton. The Third Intermediate Period brought changes in politics and society, with local rulers gaining autonomy. The Late Period witnessed Persian rule, rebellions, and a brief period of independence before Alexander the Great's conquest in 332 B.C., leading to centuries of Roman rule and the eventual introduction of Christianity and Islam to Egypt.

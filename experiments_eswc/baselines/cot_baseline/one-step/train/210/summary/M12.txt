The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1070â€“712 B.C.) began with Smendes' rule after Ramesses XI's death, leading to 350 years of divided power. Divided into three stages, the period saw Dynasty 21 ruling from Tanis and Thebes, followed by Dynasty 22 of Libyan descent, and finally Dynasty 23 emerging in the eastern Delta. The era also witnessed Nubian rule in Egypt and a shift in power to local rulers. Art and culture flourished in temple precincts, showcasing innovative bronze statuary and elaborate burial practices. The king's divine lineage was emphasized in various artistic forms, reflecting the period's artistic and cultural developments.

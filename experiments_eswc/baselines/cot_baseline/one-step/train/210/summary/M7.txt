Ancient Egypt's history is divided into distinct time periods, each characterized by different dynasties and powerful rulers. From the Early Dynastic Period with Menes and Djoser to the New Kingdom with famous rulers like Hatshepsut and Tutankhamun, Egypt saw periods of prosperity and foreign control. The Intermediate Periods were marked by challenges in central government control, while the Greco-Roman Period saw Egypt under foreign rule by figures like Alexander the Great and Cleopatra.

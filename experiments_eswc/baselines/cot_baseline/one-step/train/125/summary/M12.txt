William C. Nixon, born in 1789, served in the War of 1812 and was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates. He married Mary Ann Caudy and had several children, including Lemuel Nixon. Capon Chapel, possibly built on his land, was associated with the Primitive Baptists. Nixon's family history is intertwined with the church, with his mother-in-law being the first burial in its cemetery.

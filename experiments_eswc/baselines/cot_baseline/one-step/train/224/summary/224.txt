California entered the United States during the California Gold Rush, a period in American history following the discovery of gold by James W. Marshall. Gold had been present in California before this event, but Marshall's discovery sparked a frenzy that attracted a significant portion of the population to mining for gold. The Gold Rush had a lasting impact on California's demographics, drawing in tens of thousands of people from Latin America. San Francisco, a city named for the prospectors of the Gold Rush, became a hub for those seeking their fortunes in gold.

Indonesian police have heightened security at the Borobudur Temple, the world's largest Buddhist temple, following a threat from Islamic State supporters on Facebook. The threat, posted on August 15, warned of the temple's demolition by Islamic militants. Security measures include increased police presence, cooperation with the military, and thorough investigations into the threat. The temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has faced attacks in the past, with previous incidents of vandalism by Muslim radicals.

Indonesia boasts two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Borobudur Temple Compounds and the Komodo National Park. The Borobudur Temple Compounds, built by the Syailendra Dynasty between 750 and 842 AD, represent a blend of indigenous ancestor worship and Buddhist concepts. The site faces threats from development, tourism pressure, and natural decay, but management efforts aim to ensure its sustainability. On the other hand, the Komodo National Park, home to the Komodo Dragon, faces challenges related to tourism impacts and conservation conflicts. Efforts are made to balance preservation and commercialization while addressing threats like destructive fishing practices. Both sites use their unique features, including celebrity endorsements, to promote themselves as remarkable tourist destinations.

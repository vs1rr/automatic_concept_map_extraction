The Borobudur Temple Compound in Indonesia is a significant ancient Buddhist monument, showcasing the country's pre-Islamic history dominated by Hinduism and Buddhism. Built in the 8th and 9th centuries by the Sailendra dynasty, the temple was abandoned by the 16th century but later restored in the 20th century. Despite threats like volcanic eruptions, efforts have been made to preserve this cultural and historical icon, demonstrating its value in a predominantly Muslim country.

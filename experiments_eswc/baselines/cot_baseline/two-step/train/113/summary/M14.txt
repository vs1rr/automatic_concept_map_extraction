Borobudur is a Buddhist stupa and temple complex in Central Java, Indonesia dating from the 8th century, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The construction of Borobudur is thought to have taken 75 years and was completed in about 825 AD. The site was rediscovered in the 19th century by Thomas Stamford Raffles, and restoration efforts have been ongoing since then. Borobudur has become a major international tourist attraction, but faces challenges such as vandalism and wear and tear. The monument is an important place of worship and pilgrimage for Indonesian Buddhists. Borobudur was affected by the 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi, leading to a restoration program funded by UNESCO. The text also provides information on how to visit Borobudur, including transportation options, entrance fees, and accommodation recommendations.

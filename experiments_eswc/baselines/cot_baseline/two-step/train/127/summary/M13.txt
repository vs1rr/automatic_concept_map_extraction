The evolution of castles in medieval Europe included the development of tower houses, built for political, economic, and defensive purposes. These structures served as homes, defensive fortifications, and administrative centers. Tower houses were common in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Italy, and Central Europe, each region adding its own unique features. Surviving examples, such as Longthorpe Tower in England and Hallbar in Scotland, showcase the architectural and historical significance of these medieval structures.

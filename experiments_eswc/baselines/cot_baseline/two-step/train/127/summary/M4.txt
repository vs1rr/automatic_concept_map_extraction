Castles were built during the Middle Ages as fortified homes for kings and nobility to defend themselves and rule over their lands. Originally made of wood, they later transitioned to stone for increased strength. Castles featured defensive elements like moats, keeps, curtain walls, arrow slits, gatehouses, and battlements. Famous castles include Windsor Castle, Tower of London, Leeds Castle, Chateau Gaillard, Cite de Carcassonne, Spis Castle, Hohensalzburg Castle, and Malbork Castle. Fun facts include the evolution of tower shapes, storing ale in butteries, siege engines used in attacks, sieges to starve out defenders, and keeping cats and dogs to control pests.

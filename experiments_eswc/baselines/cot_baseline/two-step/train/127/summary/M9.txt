Castles have taken on various forms over the centuries, from ancient hill forts to Renaissance country houses. Historians debate the definition of a castle, but generally agree it is a private fortified residence of a monarch or nobleman. The word "castle" comes from the Latin word "castellum," meaning "fortified place." Castles served military, administrative, and domestic purposes, evolving in design and function over time. They were symbols of power and prestige, with aesthetics becoming increasingly important. As warfare evolved, castles lost their military significance and were eventually replaced by country houses. Despite their decline, castles remain iconic structures in Europe and the Middle East, dating back to the Middle Ages.

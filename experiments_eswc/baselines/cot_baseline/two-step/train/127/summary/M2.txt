Early castles were initially made of wood, but by the 10th century, people began constructing them from stone with walls as thick as 30 feet. Castles often had moats, drawbridges, and baileys for defense. They were strategically built on mountains, near water bodies, and on hilltops to make them harder to attack. Castles had arrow slits, heavy iron doors, and later round walls for better defense. Despite being dark and cold, castles provided protection from enemies, but were costly to maintain, so only kings, lords, and noblemen lived in them. Castles played a crucial role in defending lands and hosting feasts, but with the advent of cannons and centralized armies, their significance declined by the end of the Middle Ages.

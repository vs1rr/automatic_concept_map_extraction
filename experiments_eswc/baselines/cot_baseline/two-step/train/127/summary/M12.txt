Pembroke Castle, with its humble beginnings in 1093, has a rich history filled with architectural marvels and strategic defenses. The castle's main features include a cylindrical tower with a stone dome, circular rooms, and a gatehouse with multiple portcullises. Notably, it is the only castle in Britain built over a natural cavern.

Concentric castles are characterized by having two or more concentric curtain walls, with the outer wall lower than the inner one, creating a defense system where one wall can protect the other. These castles, like Krak des Chevaliers in Syria, were designed to withstand advances in siege technology, with features such as projecting towers for flanking fire and platforms for trebuchets. The layout of concentric castles varied based on terrain, with rectangular or irregular polygon shapes. They were costly to build and maintain, typically associated with powerful military orders or kings. The design allowed for active defense with features like intramural towers, arrow slits, and strengthened gates. The concept of concentric castles influenced later fortifications, such as those built by Edward I in Wales, and was also seen in fortified cities like Constantinople.

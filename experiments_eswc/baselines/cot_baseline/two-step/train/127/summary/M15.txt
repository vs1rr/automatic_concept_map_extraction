Harewood Castle, the oldest building at Harewood, underwent a significant restoration project in 2004-2005 with support from English Heritage and the Harewood Estate. The castle, granted a 'license to crenellate' in 1366, was designed for both security and comfort, featuring defensive elements like a portcullis alongside mullioned windows showcasing architectural craftsmanship. The castle's strategic location on a steep slope offered impressive views and status. Over the years, it was shared by different families until it fell into disrepair by the 17th century. The reasons for its abandonment remain a mystery, leaving its fate and eventual decline open to speculation.

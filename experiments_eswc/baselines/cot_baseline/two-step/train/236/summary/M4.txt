Brazil declared independence from Portugal on September 7, 1822, with Dom Pedro I proclaiming freedom in the Grito de Ipiranga. The colonial period saw Portugal focusing on other territories, leading Brazil to develop independently. The Portuguese Crown controlled Brazil for profit, restricting trade and resources. With the relocation of the Portuguese court to Rio de Janeiro in 1808, Brazil flourished culturally and economically. Jo√£o VI's decision to stay in Brazil and the subsequent attempts to reassert control led to tensions. Facing pressure and inspired by successful independence movements in Spanish America, Brazil peacefully broke away from Portugal on September 7, 1822, with Pedro I declaring "Independence or Death!" Despite the less-than-heroic circumstances of the proclamation, Portugal did not resist, making Brazil one of the few Latin American countries to gain independence peacefully and the only one to establish a monarchy post-independence.

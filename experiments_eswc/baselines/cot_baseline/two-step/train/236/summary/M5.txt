Pedro I and Pedro II played crucial roles in shaping Brazil's history in the 19th century. The events in Europe, particularly Napoleon's conquests, led to the Portuguese royal court fleeing to Rio de Janeiro in 1808. Dom João VI's stay in Brazil brought European-style institutions to the city. Pedro I's declaration of independence from Portugal in 1822 marked a turning point, with public support for a separate Brazil evident. The transition to an empire under Pedro I was a strategic move, emphasizing Brazil's independence and unique history. The artwork of Debret captures the grandeur of these events, highlighting the symbolism and significance of the Brazilian monarchy. The comparison of King João VI and Emperor Pedro I's portraits reflects their political positions, while Debret's depictions of Rio de Janeiro offer insights into the city's economy and social structure. The illustrations of Princess Leopoldine's arrival and Pedro II's assumption of leadership showcase the monarchy's importance and the support it received from Brazilian elites.

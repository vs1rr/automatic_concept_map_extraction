The text discusses the events leading to the establishment of the Manhattan Project, starting with a letter from Albert Einstein to President Roosevelt in 1939 about the potential of atomic energy for creating powerful bombs. Roosevelt eventually approved uranium research, fearing Hitler's possession of such weapons. The Manhattan Project succeeded in developing the atomic bomb during World War II, with the British and Russians also involved in research but not as successful. The Americans were the only ones to achieve a short-lived atomic monopoly by taking fission from the laboratory to the battlefield.

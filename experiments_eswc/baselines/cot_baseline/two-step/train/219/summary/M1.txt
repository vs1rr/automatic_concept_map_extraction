The British played a significant role in the Manhattan Project, but James B. Conant believed the US should limit their involvement due to concerns about secrecy and practicality. Conant argued that sharing information with the British would not significantly aid the war effort, as they were not producing fissile material. Despite initial resistance, the US eventually agreed to full cooperation with the British under the Quebec Agreement. However, Conant's concerns about secrecy proved valid when a British delegate, Klaus Fuchs, became a significant atomic spy. Ultimately, the British delegation at Los Alamos made important contributions to the project, highlighting the complexities of international collaboration during wartime.

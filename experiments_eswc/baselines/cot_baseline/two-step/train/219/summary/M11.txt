Britain's journey into nuclear weapons began with critical breakthroughs in the early 1940s, leading to cooperation with the U.S. during WWII. After the war, Prime Minister Attlee's government established secret committees to develop atomic energy policy. Physicist William G. Penney played a crucial role in Britain's atomic bomb program, leading to the first British nuclear test, code-named Hurricane, in 1952 on the Monte Bello Islands off Australia. The successful test marked Britain's entry into the nuclear arms race.

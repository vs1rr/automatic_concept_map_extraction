The Manhattan Project was a U.S. government research project from 1942 to 1945 that developed the first atomic bombs. American scientists, including refugees from Europe, organized the project to exploit fission for military purposes. The project involved various research methods to produce fissionable materials, such as uranium-235 and plutonium-239. The project also included designing and testing the atomic bombs, leading to the successful detonation of the first bomb in July 1945 in New Mexico. Subsequently, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945.

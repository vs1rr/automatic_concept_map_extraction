The Frischâ€“Peierls memorandum, written in March 1940, was a key document in the development of the atomic bomb. It contained calculations on the critical mass needed for the bomb and influenced the establishment of the secret MAUD Committee. The memorandum highlighted the potential destructive power of an atomic bomb and proposed developing one before Germany. This document played a significant role in shaping Cold War geopolitics and ultimately led to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

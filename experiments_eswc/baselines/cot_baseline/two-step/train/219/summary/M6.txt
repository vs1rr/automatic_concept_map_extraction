The Manhattan Project was a groundbreaking success in nuclear science, showcasing the power of nuclear fission reactions. Albert Einstein's letter to President Roosevelt warned of the potential of atomic bombs and the threat of Germany's nuclear project. The project was top-secret due to fears of enemy nations obtaining nuclear technology. Safety measures included radiation detectors and nose swabs for plutonium dust. The bombs "Little Boy" and "Fat Man" devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with significant loss of life. The project's cost was equivalent to less than nine days of wartime spending. Security measures included lie detector tests and strict punishments for disclosing secrets. The British played a crucial role in the project's development. Construction and testing sites were spread across the U.S. The project's success led to the atomic bombings and the establishment of the Manhattan Project.

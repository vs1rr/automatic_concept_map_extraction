Otto Robert Frisch, an Austrian-British physicist, made significant contributions to nuclear physics during World War II. He collaborated with Rudolf Peierls to design the first theoretical mechanism for an atomic bomb. Frisch's work on nuclear fission, including coining the term, was crucial in the development of atomic weapons. He conducted experiments to determine the critical mass of uranium needed for detonation. After the war, Frisch continued his research and teaching career, contributing to the field of atomic physics.

Photographer Martin Miller captured haunting images of the remnants of the Manhattan Project, showcasing the uranium production plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the plutonium reactor in Hanford, Washington. These sites were where the first atomic bomb, 'The Gadget', was developed and explosives for Hiroshima and Nagasaki were produced. The project was initiated due to concerns about Nazi Germany's similar efforts, leading to the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945. The photographs depict the monumental achievements of the Manhattan Project, highlighting the awe-inspiring engineering and scientific feats, while also acknowledging the regret for the destructive power unleashed into the world.

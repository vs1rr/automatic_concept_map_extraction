The text discusses the "CSI Effect," which refers to the influence of crime-related television shows on jurors' expectations for scientific evidence in criminal trials. The author conducted a study with two other researchers to investigate if watching shows like CSI affects juror expectations and demands for forensic evidence. The study found that while CSI viewers had higher expectations for scientific evidence, these expectations did not significantly impact their propensity to convict. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding juror expectations for forensic evidence in the criminal justice system and suggests ways for the legal system to adapt to these changing expectations.

The CSI effect refers to the public's unrealistic perception of forensic science's effectiveness, influenced by crime scene TV dramas like CSI. These shows have raised juror expectations for forensic evidence, altered prosecutorial behavior, and portrayed forensic scientists as infallible. While TV dramas may entertain with quick resolutions, the public can differentiate between fiction and reality, understanding that real forensic science differs from what is shown on TV. TV shows aim to entertain, not educate, and viewers do not necessarily expect real-life justice to be as swift as on screen.

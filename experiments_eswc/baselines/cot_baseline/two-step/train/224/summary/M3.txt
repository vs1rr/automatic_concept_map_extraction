The California Gold Rush was a period of mass hysteria and migration in American history sparked by the discovery of gold in Northern California. Despite the hopes of easy fortunes, most people only made enough to cover daily expenses. The rush began in 1848 at Sutter's Mill and led to a wave of immigration by the "49ers." The event had a significant impact on California's development, leading to the building of the Panama Railway and the growth of San Francisco. The rush also brought challenges such as strained infrastructure, crime, and the rise of vigilantes. The Gold Rush is said to have ended in 1858 with the start of the New Mexican Gold Rush, and the San Francisco 49ers NFL team is named after the prospectors of this historic event.

The California Gold Rush began in 1848 when gold was discovered by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Lumber Mill in Coloma, California, attracting 300,000 prospectors known as "forty-niners" seeking instant wealth. The rush peaked in 1849, with a single year's take reaching $80 million. The discovery predated the formal cession of California to the United States under the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The rush led to significant gold strikes at locations like Mormon Island, Bidwell's Bar, Weber's Creek, and Rich Bar, as shown on the California Gold Rush Map.

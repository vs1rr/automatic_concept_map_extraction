The Gold Rush of 1849 was sparked by the discovery of gold nuggets in the Sacramento Valley, leading to a massive influx of prospectors to the California territory. The population surged from less than 1,000 to around 100,000 by the end of 1849. James Wilson Marshall's finding of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848 marked the beginning of this historic event, with $2 billion worth of precious metal extracted during the peak of the Gold Rush in 1852.

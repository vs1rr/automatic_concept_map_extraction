Rumors of gold in California had circulated for years before the Gold Rush, but it was the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill that sparked the frenzy. John Sutter, a Swiss emigrant, established Sutter's Fort in Sacramento Valley, where he developed various businesses. In 1847, he hired James Marshall to build a sawmill at Coloma, where gold was found in January 1848. Despite Sutter's efforts to keep the discovery quiet, news spread rapidly, reaching President James Polk by December 1848, making the Gold Rush a national sensation.

The California Gold Rush was a significant period in American history following the discovery of gold by James W. Marshall in California. Gold had been present before the rush, but Marshall's discovery changed the demographic landscape of California, attracting thousands from Latin America. San Francisco was named for the prospectors of this gold rush, which forever altered the region's population and economy.

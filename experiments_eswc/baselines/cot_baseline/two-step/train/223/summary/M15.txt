The Battle of Manzikert in 1071 between the Byzantine Empire and Seljuk Turkish forces led by Alp Arslan resulted in the defeat of the Byzantine Empire and the capture of Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes. Despite relatively low casualties, the defeat marked the beginning of the decline of the Byzantine Empire. The aftermath saw political destabilization, Turkish migrations, and the eventual loss of Asia Minor to the Seljuks. The battle is considered a turning point in Byzantine history, leading to the empire's eventual downfall and setting the stage for the later Crusades.

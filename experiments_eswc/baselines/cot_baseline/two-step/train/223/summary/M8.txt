Constantine the Great, a Roman Emperor, rebuilt Byzantium into Nova Roma and legalized Christianity through the Edict of Milan. Justinian, another Emperor, reunited the Roman Empire, created Justinian's Code, and built the Hagia Sophia. The Byzantine Empire thrived due to trade and cultural influences, leading to the development of a new society. The Byzantine emperors held both political and religious power, unlike their Western counterparts. Christianity was central to Byzantine life, reflected in their art and devotion. The split between Eastern and Western Christianity eventually led to the formation of the Eastern Orthodox Church, dividing Europe.

The Macedonian Dynasty brought about the Byzantine Renaissance, a period of cultural and artistic flourishing in the Byzantine Empire. Under this dynasty, the empire expanded its territories, conquered Crete, Cyprus, and most of Syria. However, competition among nobles in the theme system led to instability and weakened the authority of the emperors. The period also saw significant religious events, such as the conversion of the Bulgarians, Serbs, and Rus' to Orthodox Christianity.

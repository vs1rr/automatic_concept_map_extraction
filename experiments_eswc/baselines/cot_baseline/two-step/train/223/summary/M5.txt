Constantine the Great divided the Roman Empire and made Christianity the dominant religion. The Visigoths, led by Alaric, sacked Rome in 410 C.E., marking the first of many invasions. Constantine's acceptance of Christianity weakened the traditional Roman beliefs and split the empire into two parts. The fall of the Roman Empire was also influenced by economic issues, trade deficits, inflation, and military problems. Germanic tribes like the Visigoths, Vandals, and Franks further contributed to the Empire's decline, leading to the fall of the western half in 476 C.E.

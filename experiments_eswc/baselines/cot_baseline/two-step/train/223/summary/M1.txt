The Byzantine Empire, originating in 330 A.D. when Constantine I established Constantinople as the new Roman capital, survived for 1,000 years after the fall of the western Roman Empire. With a rich tradition of art, literature, and learning, the empire served as a military buffer between Europe and Asia. Despite facing various threats, including attacks by Germanic tribes and the rise of Islam, the Byzantine Empire thrived under rulers like Justinian I and the Macedonian dynasty. The empire's legacy includes its influence on the Western intellectual tradition and the spread of Orthodox Christianity to regions like Russia, Romania, and Greece. The empire finally fell in 1453 when Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, marking the end of an era but leaving a lasting impact on history.

Emperor Justinian I, born in 482 CE in Illyria, reigned from 527 to 565 CE and is known as one of the most significant late Roman and Byzantine emperors. He led military campaigns to reclaim Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Goths, oversaw the construction of numerous structures, and completed the Codex Iustinianus, a compilation of Roman laws. Justinian faced challenges such as the Gothic War and the Justinianic Plague but ultimately succeeded in expanding and securing the Byzantine Empire. Despite facing revolts and civil unrest, Justinian's reign left a lasting impact on art, architecture, legal reform, and conquest, making him a prominent figure in late Roman and Byzantine history.

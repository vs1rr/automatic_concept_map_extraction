Bruce Castle Park in Haringey is located on the site of one of the four manors of Tottenham, with a mansion that has historical ties to the Scottish royal family of de Brus. The park, established in 1892, features a house that became a museum in 1906, housing a local history collection. The park offers various facilities and events, maintaining its C19th layout with many trees dating back to that time, including an ancient oak over 400 years old. The park has won a Green Flag Award for several consecutive years.

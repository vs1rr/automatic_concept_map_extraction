Bruce Castle, a 16th-century manor house in Tottenham, has a rich history dating back to the medieval period. Originally known as 'Lordship House', it has seen various owners and uses over the centuries. From royal visits to tragic deaths, the house has many stories to tell. The house was remodeled by different owners, including Henry Hare and James Townsend, before becoming a boarding school for boys in the Victorian era. The school, known for its progressive approach to discipline, attracted students from around the world and was visited by notable figures like Charles Dickens and Charles Babbage. After the school closed in 1891, the building became Tottenham's first public museum in 1906. Today, Bruce Castle is a Grade 1 listed building housing the London Borough of Haringey's archive and local history museum.

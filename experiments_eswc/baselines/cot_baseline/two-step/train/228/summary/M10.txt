The State of Coahuila y Tejas, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, had a constitutional tradition influenced by both the United States and Spanish legal systems. Under the Mexican Constitution of 1824, Texas was combined with Coahuila to form a new state. The state constitution, published in 1827, reflected elements of the Spanish tradition, including Catholicism as the state religion and the community property system. The constitution also introduced the homestead exemption from bankruptcy, providing stability for frontier families. Despite its progressive policies, discontent led to a new constitution in 1833, marking a turning point in the tensions between Texas and the Mexican government.

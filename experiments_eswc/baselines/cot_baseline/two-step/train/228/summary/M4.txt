The Convention of 1833, held in San Felipe, Texas, aimed to address various issues including repealing anti-immigration laws, improving Indian defense, and proposing a constitution for Texas. Delegates, led by William H. Wharton and including Sam Houston, sought statehood and presented a constitution inspired by Massachusetts' model. David G. Burnet was tasked with preparing a memorial to the Mexican government. Despite challenges, the convention concluded on April 13, with Stephen F. Austin later traveling alone to Mexico to present the petitions.

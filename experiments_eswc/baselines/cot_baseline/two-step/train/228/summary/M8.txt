Texian Consultations at San Felipe in 1832 and 1833 were organized by the colonists in Texas to address grievances and concerns to the Mexican government. The first Consultation in 1832 focused on issues such as repealing laws restricting immigration and reducing tariffs, while the second Consultation in 1833 aimed at achieving independent statehood within the Mexican union. Despite efforts by delegates like Stephen F. Austin and William H. Wharton to present memorials and petitions to the Mexican authorities, little response was received, leading to calls for further action and preparation for potential conflict with Mexico.

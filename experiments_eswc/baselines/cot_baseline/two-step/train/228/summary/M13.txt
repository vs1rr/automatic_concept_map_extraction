The Long Expedition in June 1819 aimed to conquer Texas, declaring it an independent Republic but was driven back by Spanish troops. James Long was captured and killed, leading to Mexican control. Various events followed, including the Battle of Velasco, the Convention of 1832, and the Battle of the Alamo. The Texians eventually won independence at the Battle of San Jacinto in April 1836, leading to the birth of the Republic of Texas despite treaty violations by both sides.

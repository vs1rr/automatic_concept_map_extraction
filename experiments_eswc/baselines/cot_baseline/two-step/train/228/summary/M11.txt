San Felipe de Austin, founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin, served as the unofficial capital of his colony and became a significant urban center in early Texas history. The town thrived as a social, economic, and political hub, with notable residents and establishments like the colonial land office and the Texas Gazette newspaper. San Felipe played a crucial role in the events leading up to the Texas Revolution, hosting important conventions and serving as the provisional government's capital. However, the town met a tragic fate during the conflict, being burned down in 1836 to prevent its capture by the Mexican army. Despite efforts to rebuild, San Felipe never fully recovered and eventually lost its status as the county seat. Today, the original townsite is preserved as a historical site, commemorating its significance in Texas history.

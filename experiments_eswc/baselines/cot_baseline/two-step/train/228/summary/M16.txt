San Felipe de Austin, known as the "Birthplace of Anglo-American Settlement in Texas," was founded by Stephen F. Austin in 1824. It played a crucial role in Texas history, hosting significant events like the Conventions of 1832 and 1833 and the Consultation of 1835, which led to the Texas Declaration of Independence. Despite being burned during the War for Independence, the town was restored and became the first urban center in the Austin colony. Today, the Stephen F. Austin State Park preserves the town's history, including a replica of Austin's cabin and a museum.

Bramshill House and Gardens, dating back to the early 17th Century, is a significant Jacobean 'Prodigy' house with a rich history of architectural evolution and ownership changes. Originally built by Edward, 11th Baron Zouche of Harringworth, the house underwent various modifications over the centuries, including additions by the Cope family and the Brocket occupation. The estate, now owned by the Home Office, is surrounded by historic parkland featuring tree avenues and landscape elements dating back to medieval times. The house served various purposes during its history, including as a maternity home during World War II and a residence for the exiled King of Romania. Today, it functions as a National Police Training College, with new buildings constructed on the estate grounds.

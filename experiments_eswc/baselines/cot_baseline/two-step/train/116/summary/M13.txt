A 402-year-old Grade-I listed building, Bramshill House, currently used as a police training college, is set to be sold by the Home Office to heritage property developers City and Country. The Jacobean building, purchased by the Government in 1952, will be transformed into a residential site. The sale price will be disclosed once the deal is finalized and recorded at the Land Registry.

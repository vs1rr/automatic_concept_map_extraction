Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, was an English diplomat known for his vote against condemning Mary, Queen of Scots, and for a stag-hunt mishap involving the Archbishop of Canterbury. He had two marriages, a notable career including serving as Ambassador to Scotland, and was involved in the Virginia Company. Zouche's interests in horticulture and the New World were evident, and he built Bramshill in Hampshire. His death in 1625 led to the Barony of Zouche falling into abeyance. Additionally, Zouche played a role in sending four children to America on the Mayflower.

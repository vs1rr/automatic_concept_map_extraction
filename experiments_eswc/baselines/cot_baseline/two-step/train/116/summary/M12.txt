UKIP MEP Marta Andreasen is calling for the closure of the European Police College (Cepol) near Hook due to alleged misuse of EU funding. Andreasen claims that over Â£20,000 of EU money was used for personal items, questioning the ethics of the college. Despite its aim to educate police officers and fight cross-border crime, concerns about spending practices have led to the European Parliament refusing to sign off on Cepol's accounts.

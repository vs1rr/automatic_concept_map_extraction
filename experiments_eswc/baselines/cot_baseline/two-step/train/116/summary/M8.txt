Bramshill House, located in Hampshire, England, is a significant Jacobean mansion with a rich history. Originally built in the early 17th century, the house showcases Italian Renaissance influences and was designated a Grade I listed building in 1952. The mansion features elaborate architecture, including a decorative southern fa√ßade with a large oriel window, a great hall displaying coats of arms, a grand drawing room, and a long gallery filled with portraits. The interior is adorned with tapestries depicting historical scenes, and the estate includes formal gardens and woodland. Over the years, Bramshill House has served various purposes, from hosting cricket matches in the 19th century to being used as a Red Cross maternity home during World War II. It later became a police training facility before being sold to developers in 2014 due to maintenance costs. The house is also known for its ghostly legends, including the tale of a bride who was locked in a chest on her wedding night and discovered decades later.

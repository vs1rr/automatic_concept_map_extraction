The Book of Kells is a significant relic containing 678 illustrated pages made of calf-skin or vellum. It was likely created in a Columban Monastery on the island of Iona and features intricate illustrations and symbols. The four symbols in the book, often thought to represent the Apostles, actually represent the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The Irish people are believed to be descendants of the Tribe of Dan, who migrated to Ireland under various names. The Book of Kells also references the four tribal standards mentioned in the Apocalypse/Revelation, linking them to the tribes of Israel. The emblems in the book symbolize the tribes to whom the Gospels were to be preached, reflecting the Irish connection to the Israelites.

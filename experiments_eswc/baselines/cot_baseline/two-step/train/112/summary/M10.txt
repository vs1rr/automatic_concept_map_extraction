The Book of Kells, a renowned illuminated manuscript created over 1,200 years ago in medieval Ireland, is now housed in the Trinity College Library in Dublin. This replica, kept at the Hackley Public Library, was acquired through a fundraising campaign. The facsimile edition is displayed in a special case, with donors' names listed. It is believed to be the only such replica in a North American public library. Visitors can view a video or borrow a commentary volume to learn more about this exquisite work of art.

Discover the history of Brougham Castle in Cumbria, built in 1214 by Robert de Vieuxpont on a Roman fort site. The castle's great tower remains intact, with later buildings destroyed by fire in 1521. Robert Clifford added a stone curtain wall around the keep and service buildings in the 1300s to fortify it against Scottish attacks. Despite periods of neglect, the castle played a crucial role in Anglo-Scottish wars and the Wars of the Roses. Visit today to explore an exhibition showcasing carved stones from the nearby Roman fort.

Brougham Castle, located next to the River Eamont on the site of an old Roman fort, has a rich history dating back to the early 13th century. Initially built by Robert de Vipont, the castle saw significant enhancements by Robert Clifford, who added a new gatehouse complex, domestic buildings, and a stone curtain wall. Despite being captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388, the castle was later restored by Lady Anne Clifford. Eventually falling into ruin, Brougham Castle is now open to the public under the care of English Heritage.

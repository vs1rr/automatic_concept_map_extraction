Brougham Castle, located in a picturesque setting beside the River Eamont, dates back to the early 13th century and incorporates Roman stones from an earlier fort. Initially built by Robert de Vipont, it was later fortified by the Clifford family to withstand attacks from the Scots. The castle saw further additions over the centuries and was eventually restored by Lady Anne Clifford. Visitors can explore the castle towers for impressive views and should not miss the Roman tombstone fragment in the inner passage. Nearby attractions include the Countess Pillar and Brougham Hall.

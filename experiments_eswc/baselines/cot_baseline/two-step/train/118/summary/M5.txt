Brougham Castle, a 13th-century fortress built on the site of a former Roman fort, strategically located at the confluence of the Lowther and Eamont rivers. Initially constructed by Robert de Vieuxpont, it evolved over the centuries through various owners, including the Clifford family. The castle saw significant developments during the Anglo-Scottish wars, with additions like a gatehouse and stone curtain wall. It played a crucial role in the War of the Roses, changing hands between the Lancastrian Cliffords and the Yorkist Nevilles. Lady Anne Clifford's restoration efforts in the 17th century revived the castle, but it later fell into disrepair and was eventually taken over by the government in 1928. English Heritage has been preserving the site since 1984, allowing visitors to explore this historical gem during the summer months.

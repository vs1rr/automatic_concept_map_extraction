Brougham Castle in Penrith, England, was built in the 13th century on the site of a Roman fort. The keep, the oldest part of the castle, features a hall, the lord's chamber, and a passage on the third floor with panoramic views. The castle, now under the care of English Heritage, was restored by Lady Anne Clifford in the 17th century but later fell into ruin.

The British Empire, once the largest state in history, covered a significant portion of the Earth's land area in the 1930s. The Order of the British Empire is a key symbol, honoring individuals from various countries for their contributions to the UK. The Basic Range of British Empire tea offers a blend of Ceylon and Indian teas, promising a consistent and astringent taste with a rich aroma and a sweet, malty aftertaste.

The British Empire was known as "the empire on which the sun never sets" due to its vast reach across the globe. Motivations for British imperialism in India included acquiring products for factories, expanding consumer markets, spreading Christianity, asserting global power, and a belief in their racial and governmental superiority. The British gained territory through a powerful navy, advanced weaponry like muskets and machine guns, efficient transportation systems like trains, and strong organizational and communication structures. Before British rule, India was not a unified political entity but rather a collection of kingdoms.

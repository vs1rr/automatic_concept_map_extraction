The British Empire originated in the late 16th century through private commercial ventures chartered by the crown, leading to the establishment of trading posts in India, the East Indies, Newfoundland, and Hudson Bay. The empire expanded with the growth of plantations in the Caribbean and North America, attracting European settlers and relying on the African slave trade for cheap labor. The Navigation Acts were passed to ensure imperial self-sufficiency and increase British wealth. By the late 17th and early 18th centuries, British encroachment on Spanish and Dutch territories and rivalry with France in India, Canada, and Africa led to the government asserting more direct control over the empire. The British East India Company's victory over its French counterpart in India and the Treaty of Paris in 1763 solidified British presence in India and Canada, but financial strains from war led to difficulties with the American colonies, culminating in the American Revolution and the end of the first British Empire.

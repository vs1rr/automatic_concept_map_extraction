The British Empire was the largest empire in history, with colonies established for trade and financial gain. It spanned over 14 million square miles and 450 million people, reaching its peak during Queen Victoria's reign. The decline began in the early 20th century due to loss of military supremacy and financial strain after World War II. The legacy of the Empire is debated, with contributions to democracy and self-government, but also criticisms of exploitation. The Empire included numerous countries, with control changing hands and boundaries shifting over time. The Union Flag, also known as the Union Jack, symbolized the British Empire, which lasted until the mid-20th century.

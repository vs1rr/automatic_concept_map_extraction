The Pendle Witch Trials in England from 1612 to 1634 were part of the Lancashire Witch Trials and are well-documented. The accused were from the Pendle Hill area and were involved in witchcraft. The trials resulted in the execution of ten individuals, with one found not guilty. The trials were notable for the involvement of a young witness and the suspension of normal rules of evidence for witchcraft cases. A later set of trials in 1633-1634 saw more individuals accused, including Margaret Johnson, who confessed but was later found innocent. The trials inspired a play and Pendle Hill remains associated with witchcraft, attracting tourists.

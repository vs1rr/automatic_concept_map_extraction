In 1612, ten people were convicted of witchcraft in Lancaster and hanged on the moors above the town. The accused, including two men and an elderly woman, were believed to have committed crimes such as laming, causing madness, and practicing witchcraft. The story of the Pendle Witches began in the remote Pendle Forest, where Alison Device's encounter with a peddler led to a series of accusations and arrests. The trials revealed shocking testimonies and resulted in the conviction and execution of the accused, highlighting the political and religious tensions of the time. The events were documented in "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster" by Thomas Potts, shedding light on a dark chapter in history where ten lives were lost to a crime that no longer exists.

The Roman province of Egypt, known as Aegyptus, was established in 30 BC under Augustus after defeating Mark Anthony and Cleopatra. The capital was Alexandria, and the province was governed by a hierarchy with a governor at the top. Egypt was a significant revenue source for Rome, with a complex tax system in place. Social hierarchy was introduced, and citizenship could be obtained through military service. Egypt was crucial for food supply to Rome, and Christianity flourished in the region, with Alexandria being a major center.

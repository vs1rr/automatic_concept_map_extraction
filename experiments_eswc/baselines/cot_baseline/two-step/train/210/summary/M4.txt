Ancient Egypt, one of the greatest civilizations in history, thrived along the Nile River for over 3000 years. The Nile provided wealth through irrigation, food, and transportation. The civilization was divided into three major kingdoms with rich culture in government, religion, arts, and writing. Pharaohs were buried in pyramids with treasures for the afterlife. The empire weakened and was conquered by various civilizations, ending with Roman rule in 30 BC. Ancient Egyptians were pioneers in makeup, writing, and inventions like the calendar and toothpaste. Cats were sacred, and the Bible mentions Egypt. Recommended books include "Sightseers: A guide to Egypt in the time of the Pharaohs" and "Mummies, Pyramids, and Pharaohs."

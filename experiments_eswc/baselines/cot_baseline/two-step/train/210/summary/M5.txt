The text discusses the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, marking the beginning of ancient Egyptian history. Before the unification, these regions were ruled by separate kingdoms with distinct symbols and crowns. The exact date of unification is believed to be around 2686 BCE, leading to the emergence of a single kingdom under a pharaoh. The merging of traditions and religious beliefs from both kingdoms resulted in a new culture, with the pharaoh being worshipped as the hawk-god Horus.

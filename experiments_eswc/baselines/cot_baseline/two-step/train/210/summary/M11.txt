The Ramesside Period was a time of prosperity and stability due to the succession of kings from one family, benefiting the people of the 19th and 20th Dynasties. There was a push to redefine the country under the Amen cult, leading to the dismantling of statues from the Amarna Period. The reformation aimed to unify faith and strengthen the kingdom. Kings extended royal tombs, showing respect for traditional customs. The elaborate royal tombs, including those of queens like Nefertari, were designed with multiple chambers and religious texts. Family was highly valued, as seen in the tombs depicting close kinship and the construction of a vast tomb for Rameses II's sons. The workers' lifestyle in Deir el-Medina reflected a culture of documenting activities and thoughts.

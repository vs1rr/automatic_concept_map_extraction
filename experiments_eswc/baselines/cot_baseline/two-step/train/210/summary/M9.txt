Ancient Egypt, a civilization that thrived for almost 30 centuries, captivated historians and archaeologists with its majestic pyramids, rich religious traditions, and beautiful art. The Predynastic Period saw the gradual development of Egyptian civilization, while the Archaic Period laid the foundations of society and kingship. The Old Kingdom was known for its pyramid builders and prosperity, followed by the turbulent First Intermediate Period. The Middle Kingdom flourished under aggressive foreign policy and pyramid-building, while the Second Intermediate Period was marked by division and foreign rule. The New Kingdom saw Egypt reunite, establish an empire, and feature powerful rulers like Queen Hatshepsut and Amenhotep IV. The Third Intermediate Period brought changes in politics and society, with local rulers gaining power. From the Late Period to Alexander's conquest, Egypt experienced Persian rule, brief independence, and ultimately fell to Alexander the Great in 332 B.C., leading to centuries of Roman rule and the eventual introduction of Christianity and Islam.

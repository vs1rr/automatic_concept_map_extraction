The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1070â€“712 B.C.) began with Smendes' rule, leading to 350 years of divided power. Divided into three stages, the period saw a shift from Dynasty 21 to Dynasty 22, ruled by Libyan descendants. The era also witnessed the rise of Dynasty 23 and fragmentation of power in Egypt. Nubia gained independence, leading to Nubian rule in Egypt for 75 years. During this time, the temple network became crucial for politics and art, with innovative bronze statuary and elaborate burial practices. The period also saw the emergence of royal themes in art and architecture, such as the birth house celebrating the king as a divine child.

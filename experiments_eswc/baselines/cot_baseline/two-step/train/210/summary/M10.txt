Ancient Egypt's roots date back over 6,000 years to the Nile River settlement. The unification of Upper and Lower Egypt marked the beginning of the Pharaonic Age, with a god-king centralizing power. The Egyptians were pioneers in various fields, such as belief in life after death, stone architecture, and writing. The Nile's annual flood influenced their beliefs and agricultural practices. The Old and Middle Kingdoms saw the peak of Egyptian civilization, with divine kingship and pyramid building. The New Kingdom expanded Egypt's power and territory, with notable rulers like Thutmose III and Ramesses II. The period also saw the rise of sun god worship and Akhenaten's monotheism. The Late Period faced challenges from external civilizations but maintained a centralized state until Persian occupation. The Twenty-sixth Dynasty marked the last great age of pharaonic civilization before falling to Persian rule.

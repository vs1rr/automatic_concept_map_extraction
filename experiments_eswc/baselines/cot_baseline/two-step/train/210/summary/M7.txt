Ancient Egypt's history is divided into distinct time periods, each characterized by different dynasties and powerful rulers. From the Early Dynastic Period with Menes and Djoser to the New Kingdom with famous rulers like Hatshepsut and Ramesses II, Egypt saw periods of prosperity and foreign control, such as during the Greco-Roman Period with figures like Alexander the Great and Cleopatra. Throughout the Intermediate Periods, Egypt faced challenges in maintaining central government control.

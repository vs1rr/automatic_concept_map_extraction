* Egypt is located in Northern Africa3.
The Nile River is the heart of Egypt.
• Nile River is 4,000 miles long (the longest river in the world!)
• Nile River flows North from central Africa to the Mediterranean sea.
• The Nile Delta is where the river splits into several channels before reaching the Mediterranean.
• The Nile flooded every year, leaving behind dark, rich soil that was good for farming.
This area (in green on the map) was called the “Black land” for the color of the soil.
• The area beyond the Black lands were harsh deserts called the “Red lands.” 4.
Upper Egypt is all the landsouth of the Nile Delta (atapproximately Memphis)Lower Egypt is the Nile Delta.
Confused? Why is Lower Egyptat the TOP of the map?Upper Egypt is further awayfrom the sea, while Lower Egypt is at sea level – so theland in Lower Egypt is at alower elevation than the land in Upper Egypt. 5.
• Egypt has natural boundaries that helped prevent invasion.
• Harsh deserts in the west and east.
• Red Sea in the east.
• Mediterranean Sea to the North • Cataracts (rapids) on the Nile to the South.
• Invaders would have to overcome these natural boundaries before they could conquer Egypt.
• Egypt’s natural barriers contributed to a feeling of safety and security for Egyptians, who prospered for over 3000 years.
6. Ancient Egyptians were polytheistic – they worshipped many god.
•Most gods were associated with natural forces (wind, rain, etc.) or heavenly bodies (moon, planets, stars).
•Two groups of gods had special importance: • Sun gods • Land gods •The sun and land gods were important because of Egypt’s dependence on the sun and river lands.
Re, Sun God7. Egyptians believed Osiris brought civilization to Egypt.
The story of Osiris was important to Egyptians because it was symbolic for resurrection.
Osiris’ brother Seth murdered him and cut his body into 14 pieces and threw the parts in the Nile. Osiris’ wife, Isis found the pieces of Osiris and with the help of other gods, brought him back to life.
The ancient Egyptians identified with Osiris and believed they could be resurrected and gain new life and be reborn.

Mummification Process: •Bodies are washed with water from the Nile.
•Workers remove liver, lungs, stomach and intestines and placed them in four special jars that were put in the tombs with the dead.
• The brain is removed through the nose.
• The body is covered in salt to absorb the Egyptians wanted to water in the body.preserve the dead for their • The body was filledfuture rebirth and with spices andresurrection, so they used a wrapped in linenprocess called soaked in resin.mummification.
• The whole process took about 70 days! 9. Egyptian pyramids were built primarily during the time of the Old Kingdom (2700 to 2200 BCE)
Pyramids were part of large building complexes dedicated to the dead, in effect a city of the dead.
The city of the dead would contain: • A large pyramid for the pharaoh.
• Smaller pyramids for his family.
Pyramid Complex • Mastabas (rectangular buildings with flat roofs) used as tombs for the Pharaoh’s officials. 10.
Pyramids were stocked with supplies for the Pharaohs resurrection.
Archaeologists have found food, furniture, boats, weapons, games, dishes, andjewels inside pyramids.
The pyramids had many chambers for storing theobjects that would be needed by the Pharaoh in his next life.

* There is contradictory information regarding the first king of Egypt.
Some authorities believe he might have been Aha, while others contend that Menes held this title.
Very little information on the Egyptian pharaohs of the first and second dynasties is known.
The few facts that are known about the sixteen or so ancient Egyptian pharaohs who ruled Egypt during this time has been gleaned from the Palermo stone, an ancient stone tablet that contains information such as lists of pharaohs and other facts of daily life from the ancient pharonic periods.

Around 3100 BCE, the first king united the villages of Upper and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom and created the first Egyptian royal dynasty.
* To symbolize the unity of Egypt, rulers wore a “double crown” representing both Upper and Lower Egypt. 14.
Kings in the Old Kingdom were called Pharaohs.
They were seen as divine (as a god or descended from a god).
Pharaohs possessed absolute power – meaning that they had unlimited power in ruling their people.

The Egyptians also grew flax, which was used to create the linen clothes they wore.
Linen was traded throughout the Mediterranean and was a valuable commodity.
Because the Nile flooded regularly, Egyptians had a positive outlook and stable daily life.
Egypt was dependent on the Nile River.
Theireconomic structure was based on the Nile River cycle of inundation (flooding) andrelinquishment (withdrawal).
When the Nile flooded, it left behind rich soilthat was good for farming.
The river was alsoused for travel and trade. 18.
Throughout all three kingdoms, Egyptian society maintained a simple structure.
The structure of Egyptian society was organized like a pyramid, with the Pharaoh nearly alone at the top, and slaves and servants making up the largestgroup at the bottom.
The Pharaoh, Nobles, and Priests made up a ruling classwho ran the government and managed wealthy estates.
The middle class was made up of soldiers, scribes, merchants, and artists.

It was a complex style of writing and took much skill to practice and learn.
A simplified version of hieroglyphics called hieratic script.
It used dashes, strokes, and curves to represent hieroglyphics.

and after Seleucus was murdered by Heliodorus, a usurper, Antiochus in turn ousted him.\\nDuring this period of uncertainty in Syria, the guardians of Ptolemy VI, the Egyptian ruler, laid claim to Coele Syria, Palestine, and Phoenicia, which Antiochus III had conquered.\\nBoth the Syrian and Egyptian parties appealed to Rome for help, but the Senate refused to take sides.\\nIn 173 Antiochus paid the remainder of the war indemnity that had been imposed by the Romans on Antiochus III at the Treaty of Apamea (188).\\nAntiochus forestalled an Egyptian expedition to Palestine by invading Egypt.\\nHe defeated the Egyptians between Pelusium and Mount Kasion, conquered Pelusium, and in 169 occupied Egypt with the exception of Alexandria, the capital.\\nPtolemy VI was Antiochus’ nephew—Antiochus’ sister, Cleopatra I, had married Ptolemy V—and Antiochus contented himself with ruling Egypt as Ptolemy’s guardian, giving Rome no excuse for intervention.\\nThe citizens of Alexandria, however, appealed to Ptolemy VIII, the brother of Ptolemy VI, and to his sister Cleopatra II to form a rival government.\\nDisturbances in Palestine forced Antiochus to return to Syria, but he safeguarded his access to Egypt with a strong garrison in Pelusium.\\nIn the winter of 169/168 Perseus of Macedonia in vain begged Antiochus to join forces with him against the danger that Rome presented to all of the Hellenistic monarchs.\\nIn Egypt, Ptolemy VI made common cause with his brother and sister and sent a renewed request to Rome for aid, and Antiochus prepared for battle.\\nThe fleet of Antiochus won a victory at Cyprus, whose governor surrendered the island to him.\\nAntiochus invaded Egypt again in 168, demanded that Cyprus and Pelusium be ceded to him, occupied Lower Egypt, and camped outside Alexandria.\\nThe cause of the Ptolemaeans seemed lost.\\nBut on June 22, 168, the Romans defeated Perseus and his Macedonians at Pydna, and there deprived Antiochus of the benefits of his victory.\\nIn Eleusis, a suburb of Alexandria, the Roman ambassador, Gaius Popillius Laenas, presented Antiochus with the ultimatum that he evacuate Egypt and Cyprus immediately.\\nAntiochus, taken by surprise, asked for time to consider.\\nPopillius, however, drew a circle in the earth around the king with his walking stick and demanded an unequivocal answer before Antiochus left the circle.\\nDismayed by this public humiliation, the king quickly agreed to comply.\\nRoman intervention had reestablished the status quo.\\nBy being allowed to retain southern Syria, to which Egypt had laid claim, Antiochus was able to preserve the territorial integrity of his realm.\\nEfforts to hellenize the kingdom\\nBoth economically and socially he made efforts to strengthen his kingdom—inhabited in the main by Orientals (non-Greeks of Asia Minor and Persia)—by founding and fostering Greek cities.\\nEven before he had begun his reign he had contributed to the building of the temple of Zeus in Athens and to the adornment of the theatre.\\nHe enlarged Antioch on the Orontes by adding a section to the city (named Epiphania after him).\\nThere he built an aqueduct, a council hall, a marketplace, and a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus.\\nBabylon, which revered him as Soter (Liberator, or Saviour) of Asia, was given a Greek colony that was granted freedom of the city.\\nAnother Epiphania was founded in Armenia.\\nEcbatana (in Persia) was also named Epiphania and became a Greek city.\\nMany of these cities were granted the right to coin their own municipal currency.\\nThe mint of Antioch on the Persian Gulf served the trade along the sea route between India and the district at the mouth of the great Mesopotamian rivers.\\nAntiochus’ hellenizing policies brought him into conflict with the prosperous Oriental temple organizations, and particularly with the Jews.\\nSince Antiochus III’s reign the Jews had enjoyed extensive autonomy under their high priest.\\nThey were divided into two parties, the orthodox Hasideans (Pious Ones) and a reform party that favoured Hellenism.\\nFor financial reasons Antiochus supported the reform party and, in return for a considerable sum, permitted the high priest, Jason, to build a gymnasium in Jerusalem and to introduce the Greek mode of educating young people.\\nIn 172, for an even bigger tribute, he appointed Menelaus in place of Jason.\\nIn 169, however, while Antiochus was campaigning in Egypt, Jason conquered Jerusalem—with the exception of the citadel—and murdered many adherents of his rival Menelaus.\\nWhen Antiochus returned from Egypt in 167 he took Jerusalem by storm and enforced its Hellenization.\\nThe city forfeited its privileges and was permanently garrisoned by Syrian soldiers.\\nThe revolt of Judas Maccabeus\\nThe Greeks and those friendly toward them were united into the community of Antiochians; the worship of Yahweh and all of the Jewish rites were forbidden on pain of death.\\nIn the Temple an altar to Zeus Olympios was erected, and sacrifices were to be made at the feet of an idol in the image of the King.\\nAgainst that desecration Judas Maccabeus, leader of the anti-Greek Jews, led the aroused Hasideans in a guerrilla war and several times defeated the generals Antiochus had commissioned to deal with the uprising.\\nJudas refused a partial amnesty, conquered Judaea with the exception of the Acra in Jerusalem, and in December 164 was able to tear down the altar of Zeus and reconsecrate the Temple.\\nAntiochus apparently had underestimated the strength of the Hasidean movement, which was behind the success in maintaining an independent Judaean state for about a century.\\nThe fighting spirit of the Jews was all the more impressive because at the beginning of their rebellion in 166 Antiochus had just demonstrated his might to the world at Daphne, near Antioch, with a grand review of his army: 46,000 foot soldiers were on parade, among them a Macedonian phalanx of 20,000 men and 500 mercenaries equipped with Roman arms, followed by 8,500 horsemen and 306 armoured elephants.\\nAntiochus then mounted a campaign against the Parthians who were threatening the empire in the east, recovered the income from that area, forced Artaxias of Armenia—who had defected—to recognize his suzerainty, founded the city of Antioch on the Persian Gulf, set out on an expedition to the Arabian coast, and, at the end of 164, died of an illness at Tabae (or Gabae, probably present Isfahan) in Persis.\\nMany believers saw his death as a punishment for his attempt to loot the shrine of Nanaia in Elam (in modern Iran).',\n",

Wilson (1865)In 1864 Wilson joined the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem, and then participated in the surveying project of Jerusalem, initiated to improve the water system of the city.\\nIn the frame of this survey Wilson drafted several topographical maps of the city and its close environs, maps still in use today.\\nWilson also documented important buildings in the Temple Mount area, the most renown being a series of arches and vaults that originally carried a bridge that stretched from the western wall of the Temple Mount to the Upper City.\\nThe first arch projecting from the western wall is indeed named after him \\'Wilson\\'s Arch\\'.\\nLater, the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF) commissioned Wilson to conduct a thorough survey of Western Palestine.\\nCharles Warren (1867)General Sir Charles Warren conducted the first thorough survey of the Temple Mount and its environs in the years 1867-1870.\\nSince the Ottoman government prohibited excavations in the sacred area and around its walls, Warren\\'s team devised with an idea of excavating a series of deep piers some distance from the walls.\\nAt the bottom of these pits they dug horizontal tunnels lined with wooden beams approaching the enclosure\\'s walls.\\nHere were encountered heaps of huge blocks originating from the collapse of the Temple Mount, as well as remarkable sewage tunnels and the foundation courses of the Herodian Temple Mount walls.\\nThe finds uncovered by Warren\\'s team were meticulously recorded.\\nOne of the piers excavated by Warren can still be observed in the northern part of the excavation area, some seventy meters north of Robinson\\'s Arch.\\nThis pier reaches the foundation courses of the western wall of the Temple Mount and a very substantial water channel, its bottom rock-cut and its upper part built as a vault.\\nThis water channel is 5 m deep below the Herodian street level.\\nIn another pier, excavated some 12.5 m west of the staircase of Robinson\\'s Arch and 8 m beneath surface level, Warren discovered the pier, which had supported Robinson\\'s arch.\\nAdjacent to the pier was a Herodian flagstone pavement; a water conduit ran beneath it.\\nNear the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount Warren had uncovered a fairly well-preserved wall segment, the eastern Ophel Wall, which was preserved fairly well.\\nIts foundation course of fieldstones, 6 m high, carried a solid wall built of large ashlars.\\nThis wall, defended by massive towers, was probably the southeastern part of empress Eudocia\\'s Wall (fifth century CE), which served through the Islamic period.\\nA drawing of this wall segment was published by Warren in the Survey of Western Palestine, Jerusalem, Album, Pl.\\nXIX.\\nKathleen M. Kenyon (1961-1967)In 1965 Kenyon cut a section (j) in order to investigate the western face of the Ottoman wall, at the point that it turns northward to the Temple Mount, opposite the Double (Hulda) Gate.\\nShe cut another section (SI) on the eastern side of the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount.\\nHere she uncovered Byzantine dwellings built atop a rock cutting (5 m high) that continued the line of the eastern wall; these she dated to the late Roman period.\\nAt a distance of 10 m to the south of the Al-Aqsa mosque Kenyon unearthed wall tops of a massive building dating to the Byzantine period.\\nThree years later Mazar identified these remains as Building II of the Umayyad period.\\nBenjamin Mazar (1968-1978)In 1968, about a year after the Six-Day-War and some one hundred years after the first excavations had taken place under the PEF, an Israeli team set out to excavate the area south and southwest of the Temple Mount.\\nThese excavations were conducted on behalf of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and the Israel Exploration Society.\\nB. Mazar was head of the expedition, with M. Ben Dov as assistant.\\nWork began near Robinson\\'s Arch and expanded to a much larger area extending from the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount to the Bab al-Maghariba gate in the north and the Old City wall and the Ophel Wall in the south.\\nThis large-scale excavation exposed remains dating from the First Temple period to the middle ages.\\nRemains of First-Temple-period date were uncovered near the Ophel Wall, including ashlar-built public buildings (later identified by E. Mazar as a monumental gate), a water cistern near the Triple (Hulda) Gate, rock-cut spaces identified as tombs, west of Robinson\\'s Arch, and a fragment of a monumental inscription in paleo-Hebrew; the deciphering of the inscription is uncertain, but it seems to relate to water.\\nFrom the Hellenistic period was found a huge bedrock surface, identified as the location of the Acra, south of the southern wall.\\nNear the Temple Mount enclosure were several ritual baths (miqva\\'ot) that had been damaged by later construction.\\nThe remains of the Second Temple period are the most significant finds unearthed in the excavations in this area.\\nThese include staircases located south of the Temple Mount, leading to the Double (Hulda) Gate, and a series of stone-cut channels connected with the Temple Mount.\\nThe pier that supported Robinson\\'s Arch was found near pavement slabs, the arch and parts of the Herodian street at its foot.\\nThe street was covered by a huge collapse of stones, some of which were decorated, one bearing the inscription \"to the trumpeting place to…\".\\nRitual baths (miqva\\'ot) and cisterns were uncovered throughout the area.\\nThe major finds of the Roman period were excavated west of Robinson\\'s Arch.\\nThese include a bathhouse, dwellings and many objects indicating a significant Roman presence, possibly of the Tenth Roman Legion.\\nA Byzantine residential quarter was also unearthed in this area.\\nThe houses were well preserved, sometimes two stories high.\\nSome of the houses exhibit polychrome mosaics, architectural elements, Greek inscriptions and an abundance of finds.\\nSouth of the Temple Mount was uncovered another part of the Ophel Wall, stretching from the Old City wall to the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount.\\nOne of the stones of the western wall, below Robinson\\'s Arch, was inscribed with a biblical text quoting Jeremiah.\\nFurther Hebrew inscriptions from the Byzantine period are inscribed on the southern wall of the Temple Mount.\\nThe excavation revealed important data on the history of Early Islamic Jerusalem.\\nFour edifices, about 90 x 90 m each, were unearthed and dated to the Umayyad period (7th-8th centuries CE).\\nThese buildings are probably part of an official facility erected by the caliph Al-Walid, and shedding new light on the status of Jerusalem during the Islamic period.\\nOther important Islamic finds date to the Fatimid period (10th-11th centuries CE): these include the remains of a city wall built atop the Byzantine Ophel Wall and a hoard of gold and silver jewelry concealed in a copper jug.\\nThe foundations of a massive medieval tower, blocking the greater part of the Double (Hulda) Gate, were exposed adjacent to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\\nAt the foot of Robinson\\'s Arch were a number of graves with gravestones engraved with Arabic inscriptions.\\nMeir Ben Dov (1975)During the 1970s and in early in the 1980s, M. Ben Dov conducted wide-scale excavations along the southern wall of the Old City, from the Dung Gate to Zion Gate (the area of the Bet Shalom archaeological park).\\nA Second-Temple-period dwelling quarter, with a large number of ritual baths (miqva\\'ot), was uncovered, as well as a Byzantine residential area on the slope above the Eastern Cardo, south of the Nea Church.\\nOne of the most important finds in this area is the outer wall of the southeastern apse of the Nea Church; near it to the west were the remains of a large edifice, probably a monastery.\\nAdjacent to the Old City wall was a tower (the Sulfur Tower), which formed part of the medieval fortifications of the city, and continued in use during the Ottoman period.\\nAlso, there were segments of the Lower Aqueduct that led water from the Hebron Hills to the Temple Mount, which date from the Second Temple to the Ottoman period.\\nWest of the Dung Gate, on both sides of the Old City wall, were the remains of a stone pavement belonging to the Eastern Cardo of the Byzantine period.\\nOn the outer side of the Old City wall pedestals were recovered, evidently in situ, with large columns lying nearby.\\nThese columns originally supported a roof that ran along the street.\\nWest of the street were rock-cut spaces that had served as stores.\\nA medieval gatehouse was uncovered at the point where the Old City wall overruns the Eastern Cardo.\\nEilat Mazar (1986-1987)In the 1980s E. Mazar conducted an excavation in the area between the Ophel on the north and the spur of the City of David on the south.\\nThis area is adjacent to the Ophel Wall, north of the massive tower uncovered by Warren, at the end of the path leading from the Gihon spring to the Temple Mount.\\nA gate and a public building of the First Temple period were unearthed.\\nThe gate is of the four-compartment-type, and the building consists of rectangular rooms separated by narrow corridors.\\nThe building might have served as a storeroom as indicated by the vast amount of storage vessels.\\nThe Israel Antiquities Authority (1994-2000)Excavations, commenced in 1994, were headed by Ronny Reich with the collaboration of Ya\\'aqov Billig, concentrating in the area of the Herodian street west of the Temple Mount.\\nMore than 70 m of the street were exposed, along with the stores that flanked it.\\nDuring clearance of the stone collapse beneath Robinson\\'s Arch, dozens of architectural elements came to light.\\nThese were parts of the original arch: stairs, stairwells and carved blocks.\\nThe uncovering of the Herodian street included the dismantling of the eastern wall of the Umayyad building (No.\\nIV); among its building blocks were a number of reused theatre seats.\\nThe excavation also exposed parts of the Eastern Cardo, while reopening the blocked Ayyubid Gate.\\nBetween the years 1997 and 2000 Yuval Baruch joined Ronny Reich in excavating the area near the Triple (Hulda) Gate and the subterranean spaces of the Umayyad building (No.\\nIII), where the Davidson Center was to be constructed.\\nThe excavations near the Triple Gate yielded an abundance of architectural elements, which were reused in later structures.\\nThese were originally part of the Royal Stoa built by Herod along the southern wall of the Temple Mount.\\nEast of the gate, the exposure of the rock-cut and built piers was completed.\\nThese supported the stepped street that ran along the southern wall of the Temple Mount, from the southeastern corner to the Triple Gate.\\nNear the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount some probes were dug, in which remains dating to the First Temple period were found; also seven foundation courses of the Herodian enclosure, and many finds of Late Roman period.\\nThe excavations in Umayyad Building III uncovered six huge spaces full of earth with an abundance of finds.\\nThese spaces were originally intended as foundations, meant to level the slope.\\nIt was discovered that the Umayyad building extended west to the Eastern Cardo, and was connected to the street via a large gate.\\nFurther, that the southern wall of Umayyad Building II, unearthed by Kenyon, predates Umayyad Building III and might well be of Byzantine date.\\nAnother excavation, conducted in the area of the bathhouse west of Robinson\\'s Arch, dated its final destruction to the Byzantine period.\\nIts walls were reused as foundations for Umayyad Building IV.',\n",
       " 'Where was the First Temple?\\nThe Book of Genesis (22:7 -14) tells us that the near-sacrifice of Isaac occurred on the Mountain of Yahweh in \"the land of Moriah\":And Isaac said, \"Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\"\\nAnd Abraham said, \"God will provide [yireh] Himself with the lamb for burnt offering, my son.\\nThey come to the place.\\nAbraham builds the altar, arranges the wood, ties Isaac up, and places him on the altar.\\nHe takes the knife.\\nBut the angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky, and said, \"Abraham, Abraham!\\n\" He said, \"Here I am.\\n\" He said, \"Don’t lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him.\\nFor now I know that you fear [???\\n= yireh] God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.\\n\" Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.\\nAbraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.\\nAbraham called the name of that place Yahweh-yireh [\"will provide\"].\\nAs it is said to this day, \"On Yahweh’s mountain, yera\\'eh [\"it will be provided\"].”\\nThe Samaritans identify Yahweh\\'s mountain with Gerizim, but the post-exilic writer of Chronicles (2 Chron.\\n3:1) puts it in Jerusalem.\\nWhether or not we can relate Mount Moriah to Jerusalem, there were additional reasons to build the temple here.\\nFor during the city\\'s first eight centuries, the Jerusalemites lived on this hill alone - albeit farther down, on the narrower spur to the south, near the spring.\\n(Details) Here, however, on the peak, was the outcropping of bedrock that today gives the Dome its name.\\nPerhaps it exerted a numinous power.\\nAdmittedly, though, the rock is nowhere mentioned in our sources until 333 AD, if then.\\nIt is possible that the pre-Israelite denizens of the city worshipped from this hill, facing west as the Israelites later would.\\nFor the name \"Jerusalem\" means not \"city of peace,\" as popular etymology has it, but a place \"founded by Salem,\" the Canaanite god of the setting sun.\\nKeel proposes that, under Egyptian influence, the pre-Davidic Jerusalemites had an open-air sanctuary to the sun-god here; he also holds that the easterly orientation of Solomon\\'s temple perpetuated this tradition.\\nIndeed, David must have established an accord with Jerusalem\\'s earlier inhabitants, the Jebusites, for he goes \"up\" and buys the threshing floor of Arauna the Jebusite, erecting a sacrificial altar there ( 2 Samuel 24: 24 - 25).\\nThe passage does not say where this threshing floor was, but the area of the rock is windy enough.\\nIf we accept the account in 1 Kings 6 and 7, Solomon\\'s palace was bigger than the temple.\\nThe palace was 100 cubits long, 50 wide, and 30 high, taking 13 years to build.\\nThe temple, by contrast, was 60 cubits long by 20 wide and 30 high, taking 7 years.\\n(A note on the height.)\\nThe arrangement of these buildings is not stated, although it is clear from 1 Kings 7: 21 that the temple faced east.\\nThere would not have been space for such large edifices in the City of David, which was below to the south.\\nBecause of the deep valleys, the only room for that original city\\'s expansion was to the north.\\nNo trace of palace or temple (or of anything, almost, from the First Temple period) has been found in the Ophel excavations, so we are left with the space beneath Herod\\'s temple platform.\\nThis is under the civil control of the Muslim Supreme Council (Waqf).\\nEven if the Waqf permitted digging, however, it is doubtful whether any structural remains from the early time would turn up.\\nThe area underwent radical rebuilding by Herod.\\nFurthermore, for centuries after the destruction of 70 AD - until the 7th-century Muslims cleaned it up and erected their sanctuaries - it was exploited as a source of building stones and as farmland.\\nBefore Solomon\\'s palace and temple were built, the hill would have afforded an ideal place from which to attack the city, as we can see in the contour lines that Charles Warren and Charles Wilson were able to establish:The building of the palace and temple near the peak may have been, in part, an act of fortification.\\nThe amply level area around today\\'s Dome of the Rock was partly defended against attack from the north by valleys entering from east and west.\\nYou can see them by enlarging the map on the right, (which is mainly devoted to the cisterns and water supply).\\nThe valleys fail to unite, but precisely in the stretch between them, Wilson and Warren, saw that \"the rock gives place to turf, and there are other indications which would lead us to believe that there was at one time a ditch cut in the solid rock.”\\nThe ditch would have helped to protect a pre-Herodian Temple.\\nStrabo mentions this ditch in his Geography XVI Par.\\n40, saying that Pompey filled it in order to conquer the temple in 63 BC.\\nHe tells us it was 60 feet deep and 250 feet wide.\\nJosephus also mentions Pompey\\'s filling of the ditch, saying that the Romans did the work on the Sabbaths, when the Jews refrained from fighting if not attacked.\\n(One wonders whether the same method might have been used by the Romans when they built the assault ramp at Masada in 73 AD.)\\nAnd here are broader views, the first showing more of the natural hill as it appears at a N-S line running through the Dome, the bottom one showing the depth of the valley at a N-S line running through the Haram\\'s eastern wall:As to what the ditch defended, an ancient square platform has been discerned in the Haram by Leen Ritmeyer.\\nIn order to link this platform with the First Temple, however, we must assume with Ritmeyer that those who built the Second, starting in 520 BC (66 years after the First was destroyed), would not have had the resources to erect the walls from scratch - rather they would have built upon what remained of the earlier walls.\\nAs said above, 1 Kings 7 indicates that the platform of the First Temple included a palace that was bigger than the temple.\\nIn his reconstruction (summarized below), Ritmeyer does not include the palace on the platform, apparently because he follows the account in the Mishna.\\nBut the Mishna purports to describe the Second Temple, not the First, and it was compiled around 200 AD, seven centuries after the palace had last been seen on the mountain.\\nIn short, if the following reconstruction pertains indeed to the First Temple period, then we should envision, on the platform, both palace and temple.\\nRitmeyer\\'s reconstruction of the ancient platform begins about 15 meters south of the excavated ditch, at the lowest step in the northwest staircase leading down from the present-day upper platform.\\n(To locate the staircase, consult the map below.)\\nIt was archaeologist Benjamin Mazar, Ritmeyer\\'s mentor, who first noticed something peculiar about this step: its stones are much larger than those in the steps above it.\\nOn one of them, in fact, a margin and a protruding boss were once partly visible (they are no longer so, because the adjacent pavement has been raised).\\nA colleague of Ritmeyer\\'s also pointed out that this lowest step (and hence its whole staircase) does not line up with the wall of the present-day platform as do the other staircases.\\nInstead, it is parallel to the Haram\\'s eastern wall.\\nHere is a photograph of the step in context, followed by a closer look at its ashlars:For a closer look at the stones in the lowest step, please enlarge the photo on the right.\\nAt a point near the northern edge of this step, the big stones cease and we find small ones as on the steps above.\\nRitmeyer noted that \"the northern end of the northernmost large stone of this step was exactly in line with the northern edge of the raised Muslim Platform.\\n\" It is also in line with a cut scarp (observed by Charles Warren), on which the northern edge of the Muslim platform is built.\\nIf we continue this line to the east, we reach a point in the eastern wall a bit north of the Golden Gate.\\nThe distance from the stone in the lowest step to the eastern wall is 500 royal cubits (861 feet, such a cubit being 20.67 inches long).\\nThis is a remarkable finding, because in Ezekiel\\'s vision of the future temple, as well as in the Mishnah, the temple platform is presented as a square with 500 cubits per side.\\nBelow is Ezekiel 42:15-20.\\nWhere I have put \"cubits,\" the standard Hebrew version has the word for \"reeds\"; for this alteration, see Milgrom and Block, p. 101, n. 268.\\nNow when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faces toward the east, and measured it all around.\\nHe measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred cubits, with the measuring reed all around.\\nHe measured on the north side five hundred cubits with the measuring reed all around.\\nHe measured on the south side five hundred cubits with the measuring reed.\\nHe turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred cubits with the measuring reed.\\nHe measured it on the four sides.\\nIt had a wall around it, the length five hundred, and the width five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.\\nThe 500-cubit line from the northwest staircase reaches the Haram\\'s eastern wall at the point where, in the wall\\'s lower parts, Warren saw the beginning of Herod\\'s northward extension (see the map below).\\nThe stones in the lower levels south of this point belong to the older wall of the platform.\\nHerod, be it noted, could not expand the platform eastward, because the slope of the Kidron Valley is too steep, so he used the older wall, extending it to the north and south.\\nIf we now follow this eastern wall to the south for 500 royal cubits, we come to a slight bend (not visible from a distance), which is 240 feet north of the southeast corner (again, see the map below).\\nSouth of this bend, in the lower parts, is masonry usually identified as Hasmonean, although Yoram Tsafrir suggests that it belonged to the wall of the Seleucid Acra.\\n.\\nIn any case, it is evidence of expansion in the 2nd century BC, and it is followed by Herod\\'s extension, which stretches southward 106 feet to the present-day corner.\\nWe do not know whether the masonry changes north of the bend, because in the lower level, where the Seleucid or Hasmonean stones are, Warren did not penetrate far enough to the north, and the political situation has precluded further underground exploration.\\nNevertheless, Ritmeyer has managed to study two visible stones that are just above ground slightly north of the bend, and he dates them to the time of Hezekiah.\\nFrom the bend we go west, keeping parallel to the northern line and staying ever so slightly north of the E-shaped cistern (which Ritmeyer suggests belonged to the Acra).\\nAt 500 cubits we reach a point intersected by a 500-cubit-long line from our starting point (namely, from the lowest step of the northwest staircase).\\nThis point (see the map above) is situated where the eastward ascent to Herod\\'s platform from Barclay\\'s Gate made a 90 degree turn to the south.\\nRitmeyer proposes that Herod\\'s builders did not want to break through the Seleucid or Hasmonean wall (in green on the map) and so they built the turn.\\nIn this way we complete a square of 500 royal cubits on each side.\\nAs said above, that is exactly the number given in Ezekiel 42:15-20.\\nWas this vision inspired by the exiled prophet\\'s memory of the First Temple?\\nOr should we suppose, contra Ritmeyer, that the platform did not not belong to the First Temple at all, but rather that it was built by the returnees, starting in 520 BC, in deliberate accord with Ezekiel?\\nThis too is possible.\\nThe 500-cubit square is also present in the Mishnah.\\nIts authors were presumably describing the last temple (they do not say otherwise), whose Herodian sides were much longer than 500 cubits.\\nPerhaps they meant the part of Herod\\'s temple into which only Jews were permitted, and perhaps this coincided with the older 500-cubit square described above.\\nWe note at the bottom of the above map, in this connection, that the tunnels from the double and triple gates emerge into daylight precisely on the southern line of the 500-cubit platform.\\nPerhaps these gates were intended only for Jews who, having just taken the obligatory ritual bath, wanted to enter directly into the pure area.\\nGentiles could have entered the impure area by the western gates.\\nBut can we get any closer to the First Temple?\\nJosephus (War V 5.1 ) indicates that Solomon\\'s temple was built on the top of the hill:Now this temple, as I have already said, was built upon a strong hill.\\nAt first the plain at the top was hardly sufficient for the holy house and the altar, for the ground about it was very uneven, and like a precipice; but when king Solomon, who was the person that built the temple, had built a wall to it on its east side, there was then added one cloister [portico] founded on a bank cast up for it, and on the other parts the holy house stood naked.\\nBut in future ages the people added new banks, and the hill became a larger plain.\\nYet how did Josephus know where Solomon\\'s temple was?\\nHe doesn\\'t say.\\nHe may have been \"reading back\" from Herod\\'s, which he did know.\\nWe might attempt to justify this method as follows: Between the first temple, destroyed in 586 BC, and the second, commenced in 520, there were always Jerusalemites living here who could point to the site.\\nWhen the Jews began building the Second Temple, they would presumably have done so on the place of the First.\\nIn turn, that would have been the site of Herod\\'s grander version, which Josephus knew.\\nThere is a hitch in the logic, however.\\nIf 1 Kings 6 and 7 are accepted as historical, then the king\\'s palace overshadowed the temple.\\n(Note that Josephus does not locate Solomon\\'s palace on this hill.)\\nAfter the return from the Babylonian exile, Jerusalem had no king - hence no need for a palace.\\nOnly a temple was built.\\nThis major change might well have occasioned a corresponding change in the layout.\\nAs to the 500-cubit-square platform, supposing that it did belong to the First Temple, the question remains as to which king of Judah built it - and dug its defensive ditch.\\nIn his book The Quest, Ritmeyer nominates Hezekiah, allowing, however, that a definitive answer requires excavation.\\nThe Holy of Holies\\nThe Holy of Holies may have been where the Dome of the Rock is.\\nFrom 1 Kings 6:16, we know it was at the western extremity of Solomon\\'s temple.\\nAs the contour maps show (see above), you could not go more than a few yards west of the rock without sliding downhill.\\nLeen Ritmeyer has noticed a few tantalizing features of the rock.\\nThere are cuttings all over: perhaps the rock was quarried for building stones.\\nYet several cuttings may be ancient, and these arouse special interest.\\nLet us stand near the reliquary, on the western side looking east (use the picture below); between us and the hole in the rock (which Ritmeyer calls Crusader, ignoring the Bordeaux pilgrim of 333), we see sections that someone cut flat.\\nThe total width of these flat sections, north to south, is 10 feet, 4 inches: 6 royal Egyptian cubits.\\nRitmeyer thinks that these were foundation trenches for building stones.\\nAccording to the Mishnah, the walls of the Holy of Holies were 6 cubits thick.\\nStill using the picture above, let us try to imagine this wall.\\nNote that the \"foundation trenches\" do not continue all the way to the point where the western wall of the Holy of Holies would have been.\\nThere is an awkward upwelling of stone just east of the reliquary.\\nOn Ritmeyer\\'s theory, this area too should be flat.\\nApart from that, the theory works nicely -- and harbors another surprise.\\nHaving imagined this southern wall of the Holy of Holies, let us picture its western wall (starting about where the reliquary is) and  its northern one, of equal length, as well as the curtain on the east.\\nThe result is the biblical square with 20 cubits on each side.\\nLooking at the rock from above, we find in the center a rectangular cut, perpendicular to the western scarp.\\nRitmeyer estimates it as 1.5 by 2.5 royal cubits.\\nThese are the dimensions of the Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 25:10 ).\\nRitmeyer\\'s theory is at once exciting and exasperating.\\nHe may have found the place of the ark.\\nThere remains the problem of the awkward lump, mentioned above.\\nAnd the rock has been so chipped away!\\nBeginning a few feet to the east of the putative \"cutting for the ark,\" we can see, as the rock slopes down, the traces of a series of cuttings with a similar form and axis.\\nAlong with the supposed \"foundation trenches,\" these traces leave the impression of quarrying.\\nSo does the sudden drop on its north side.\\nThe \"cutting for the ark\" may be the impression left by a quarried stone.\\nOr perhaps it was the cutting for the ark.\\nAt the time of the Second Temple (515 BC - 70 AD), no ark was present in the Holy of Holies.\\nFurthermore, if the Second Temple was built here, then according to the height-measurements in Josephus and the Mishna, it would have been beneath the floor (see David Jacobson.)\\nThis would indicate that the builders had no scruples about placing pavement over the rock, so perhaps it did not exert such numinous power as to determine the site of the temple, First or Second.\\nWe recall that the rock goes unmentioned in the sources before 333 AD.\\nWhy then should we believe that the temple or altar were ever built on it?\\nMore puzzles\\nConsider the area of the Ophel by enlarging the picture on the right.\\nExtensive excavations were carried out on the Ophel for a decade after the 1967 War, yielding very little from the First Temple period, although much from Herod\\'s time and later.\\nNevertheless, a few First Temple vessels did turn up at the bottom of a cistern near the Second Temple\\'s southern retaining wall.\\nAnother exception was in the area near the modern road.\\nHere in 1976 archaeologists Benjamin Mazar and Meir Ben Dov found part of a public building, pictured here, containing vessels that had been charred in the destruction of 586 BC.\\nA decade later Mazar\\'s granddaughter, Eilat, continued the dig.\\nOn the basis of the pottery, she dated the floor to the end of the 8th century.\\nThis floor had been preceded by an earlier one.\\nThe fill beneath the latter yielded very little pottery, but between two foundation stones she found a black juglet, intact, that fits into the palm of a hand.\\nIts type was used in the 10th and 9th centuries BC.\\nIt may have been an heirloom, placed between the stones as a kind of votive offering.\\nOn this basis, she first dated the lower floor - and the original building - to the 9th or early 8th centuries.\\nThis does not bring us back as far as Solomon, but she has since revised her view, taking the juglet as evidence for a 10th century - Solomonic - date.\\nA few meters to the south and east, furthermore, are two towers discovered by Charles Warren in the 19th century.\\nBeneath the smaller of them, in 1967, Kathleen Kenyon found masonry consisting of large stones laid in a header-stretcher pattern, pictured here as \"2\":Eilat Mazar interprets this segment as part of the wall attributed to Solomon in 1 Kings 9: 15.\\nThe segment was not necessarily part of a tower, although the smaller tower later incorporated it.\\nThe larger may be the \"projecting tower\" referred to in Nehemiah 3: 24-27.\\nIf we grant a Solomonic date for some of the sections that the Mazars and Ben Dov uncovered, we still have the question as to why the rest of the Ophel is so scarce on remains from before the 8th century BC.\\nOne does not like an argument from silence, but given the amount of digging that has been done in the Ophel, the silence here is deafening.\\nStrategically, it would not have made sense to build the palace and temple above, where the Dome of the Rock is today, while leaving an empty space between the acropolis and the rest of the city.\\nAn enemy could easily take the waterless acropolis and use its buildings as fortresses while attacking the City of David.\\nIn favor of the biblical account, we may raise two observations.\\nFirst, yes, the silence is deafening, but in a mountain city like Jerusalem - to quote the adage - \"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\\n\" The intensive building activity on the Ophel under Herod and later the Omayyads might well have shaved away any First Temple foundations and with them any chance of finding First Temple pottery in situ.\\n(Some was found in earth-fills between later walls, but this is not evidence, for it

       " 'The Hasmonean dynasty[2] was the ruling dynasty of Judea and surrounding regions during Classical antiquity.\\nBetween c.?\\n140 and c.?\\n116 BC, the dynasty ruled semi-autonomously from the Seleucids in the region of Judea.\\nFrom 110 BC, with the Seleucid empire disintegrating, the dynasty became fully independent, expanded into the neighbouring regions of Samaria, Galilee, Iturea, Perea, and Idumea, and took the title \"basileus\".\\nSome modern scholars refer to this period as an independent kingdom of Israel.\\n[3] In 63 BC, the kingdom was conquered by the Roman Republic, broken up and set up as a Roman client state.\\nThe Kingdom had survived for 103 years before yielding to the Herodian Dynasty in 37 BC.\\nEven then, Herod the Great tried to bolster the legitimacy of his reign by marrying a Hasmonean princess, Mariamne, and planning to drown the last male Hasmonean heir at his Jericho palace.\\nThe dynasty was established under the leadership of Simon Maccabaeus, two decades after his brother Judas the Maccabee ( ?????\\n?????\\n\"Y\\'hudhah Ha\\nMakabi\") defeated the Seleucid army during the Maccabean Revolt.\\nAccording to historical sources, including 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees and the first book of The Jewish War by Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (AD 37–c.?\\n100),[4] after Antiochus IV\\'s successful invasion of Ptolemaic Egypt was turned back by the intervention of the Roman Republic,[5][6] Antiochus instead moved to assert strict control over the Seleucid satrapy of Coele Syria and Phoenicia,[7] sacking Jerusalem and its Temple, suppressing Jewish and Samaritan religious and cultural observances,[7] and imposing Hellenistic practices.\\nThe ensuing revolt by the Jews (167 BC) began a twenty-five-year period of Jewish independence potentiated by the steady collapse of the Seleucid Empire under attacks from the rising powers of the Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire.\\nHowever, the same power vacuum that enabled the Jewish state to be recognized by the Roman Senate c.?\\n139 BC was later exploited by the Romans themselves.\\nHyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Simon\\'s great-grandsons, became pawns in a proxy war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great.\\nThe deaths of Pompey (48 BC), Caesar (44 BC), and the related Roman civil wars temporarily relaxed Rome\\'s grip on Israel, allowing a very brief Hasmonean resurgence backed by the Parthian Empire.\\nThis short independence was rapidly crushed by the Romans under Mark Antony and Octavian.\\nThe installation of Herod the Great (an Idumean) as king in 37 BC made Israel a Roman client state and marked the end of the Hasmonean dynasty.\\nIn AD 6, Rome joined Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea (biblical Edom) into the Roman province of Iudaea.\\nIn AD 44, Rome installed the rule of a Roman procurator side by side with the rule of the Herodian kings (specifically Agrippa I 41–44 and Agrippa II 50–100).\\nEtymologyCoin of Antigonus, BC 40–37Coin of Alexander Jannaeus, BC 103–76The family name of the Hasmonean dynasty originates with the ancestor of the house, Greek: ?\\nsaµ??\\na???\\n(Asamoneus or Asmoneus) (see Josephus Flavius),[8] who is said to have been the great-grandfather of Mattathias, but about whom nothing more is known.\\nAn alternative view posits that the Hebrew name Hashmona\\'i is linked with the village of Heshbon, mentioned in Joshua 15:27.\\n[9] Gott and Licht attribute the name to \"Ha Simeon,\" a veiled reference to the Simeonite Tribe.\\n[10]BackgroundAt the beginning of the 2nd century BC, the Seleucid Empire (in yellow) expanded into Israel at the expense of Ptolemaic Egypt (blue).\\nThe lands of the former Kingdom of Israel and Kingdom of Judah (c.?\\n722–586 BC), had been occupied in turn by Assyria, Babylonia, the Achaemenid Empire, and Alexander the Great\\'s Hellenic Macedonian empire (c.?\\n330 BC), although Jewish religious practice and culture had persisted and even flourished during certain periods.\\nThe entire region was heavily contested between the successor states of Alexander\\'s empire, the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt, during the six Syrian Wars of the 3rd–1st centuries BC: \"After two centuries of peace under the Persians, the Hebrew state found itself once more caught in the middle of power struggles between two great empires: the Seleucid state with its capital in Syria to the north and the Ptolemaic state, with its capital in Egypt to the south...Between 319 and 302 BC, Jerusalem changed hands seven times.\"\\n[11]Under Antiochus III the Seleucids wrested control of Israel from the Ptolemies for the final time, defeating Ptolemy V Epiphanes at the Battle of Panium in 198 BC.\\nSeleucid rule over the Jewish parts of the region then resulted in the rise of Hellenistic cultural and religious practices: \"In addition to the turmoil of war, there arose in the Jewish nation pro-Seleucid and pro-Ptolemaic parties; and the schism exercised great influence upon the Judaism of the time.\\nIt was in Antioch that the Jews first made the acquaintance of Hellenism and of the more corrupt sides of Greek culture; and it was from Antioch that Judea henceforth was ruled.\"\\n[12]Historical sources\\nWojciech Stattler\\'s Machabeusze (Maccabees), 1844\\nThe origin of the Hasmonean dynasty is recorded in the books 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees, covering the period from 175 to 134 BC during which time the Hasmonean dynasty became semi-independent from the Seleucid empire but had not yet expanded far outside of Judea.\\nThe books are considered part of the Biblical canon by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches and apocryphal by most Protestant Christians, but are not a part of the Hebrew Bible.\\nThey are written from the point of view that the salvation of the Jewish people in a crisis came from God through the family of Mattathias, particularly his sons Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan Apphus, and Simon Thassi, and his grandson John Hyrcanus.\\nThe books include historical and religious material from the Septuagint that was codified by Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians.\\nThe other primary source for the Hasmonean dynasty is the first book of The Wars of the Jews by the Jewish historian Josephus, (37–shortly after AD 100).\\n[4] Josephus\\' account is the only primary source covering the history of the Hasmonean dynasty during the period of its expansion and independence between 110 to 63 BC.\\nNotably, Josephus, a Roman citizen and former general in the Galilee, who survived the Roman-Jewish wars of the 1st century, was a Jew who was captured by and cooperated with the Romans, writing his books in Rome, which has caused some to question his impartiality and credibility as a historian.\\n[13]The books of Maccabees use the names \"Judea\" and \"Israel\" (or cognates) as geographical descriptors throughout for both the land and people over whom the Hasmoneans would rule.\\nThe Talmud includes one of the Hasmonean kings under the description \"Kings of Israel\".\\nScholars refer to the state as the Hasmonean Kingdom to distinguish it from the previous kingdoms of Israel.\\nThe name \"Judaea\" has also been used to describe the Hasmonean Kingdom although this name reflects the later designation of the region under the Romans at the time of Josephus\\' writings in the late 1st century.\\nSeleucid rule over Israel\\nHellenizationCoin with portrait of Antiochus IV.\\nReverse shows Apollo seated on an omphalos.\\nThe Greek inscription reads ??\\nS???\\nOS ????????\\nT???\\n???\\nF????\\nS ????\\nF????\\n(King Antiochus, the divine Epiphanus, Bringer of Victory.\\nThe Hellenization of the Jews in the pre-Hasmonean period was not universally resisted.\\nGenerally, the Jews accepted foreign rule when they were only required to pay tribute, and otherwise allowed to govern themselves internally.\\nNevertheless, Jews were divided between those favoring Hellenization and those opposing it, and were divided over allegiance to the Ptolemies or Seleucids.\\nWhen the High Priest Simon II died in 175 BC, conflict broke out between supporters of his son Onias III (who opposed Hellenization and favored the Ptolemies) and his son Jason (who favored Hellenization and the Seleucids).\\nA period of political intrigue followed, with priests such as Menelaus bribing the king to win the High Priesthood, and accusations of murder of competing contenders for the title.\\nThe result was a brief civil war.\\nThe Tobiads, a philo-Hellenistic party, succeeded in placing Jason into the powerful position of High Priest.\\nHe established an arena for public games close by the Temple.\\n[14] Author Lee I. Levine notes, \"The \\'piece de resistance\\' of Judaean Hellenization, and the most dramatic of all these developments, occurred in 175 BC, when the high priest Jason converted Jerusalem into a Greek polis replete with gymnasium and ephebeion (2 Maccabees 4).\\nWhether this step represents the culmination of a 150-year process of Hellenization within Jerusalem in general, or whether it was only the initiative of a small coterie of Jerusalem priests with no wider ramifications, has been debated for decades.\"\\n[15] Some Jews are known to have engaged in non-surgical foreskin restoration in order to join the dominant cultural practice of socializing naked in the gymnasium, where their circumcision would have been a social stigma.\\n[16]Antiochus IV against Jerusalem\\nThe Hellenistic trends in Jewish society were, however, inadequate protection against Antiochus.\\nIn 168 BC, after successfully invading the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt (apparently without Jewish support), Antiochus IV was pressured by the Roman Republic to withdraw.\\nAccording to Livy, \"Popilius...placed in [Antiochus\\'] hand the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate [to withdraw]...[and] drew a circle round the king with the stick he was carrying and said, \\'Before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate.\\'\"\\n[17] Returning toward Antioch, the troops of Antiochus sacked Jerusalem and removed the sacred objects from the Jerusalem Temple, slaughtering an unknown, but large, number of Jews:    \"And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned again in the hundred forty and third year, and went up against Israel    and Jerusalem with a great multitude,    And entered proudly into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof...    And when he had taken all away, he went into his own land, having made a great massacre, and spoken very proudly.\\nTherefore there was a great mourning in Israel, in every place where they were.\"\\n(1 Maccabees 1:20–25)[18]He then imposed a tax and established a fortress in Jerusalem.\\nAntiochus tried to suppress public observance of Jewish laws, apparently in an attempt to secure control over the Jews.\\nHis government set up an idol of Zeus[19] on the Temple Mount, which Jews considered to be desecration of the Mount; it also forbade both circumcision and possession of Jewish scriptures, on pain of death.\\nAccording to Josephus,    \"Now Antiochus was not satisfied either with his unexpected taking the city, or with its pillage, or with the great slaughter he had made there; but being overcome with his violent passions, and remembering what he had suffered during the siege, he compelled the Jews to dissolve the laws of their country, and to keep their infants uncircumcised, and to sacrifice swine\\'s flesh upon the altar.\"\\n[20]JUDAEA, Hasmoneans.\\nJohn Hyrcanus I (Yehohanan).\\n135-104 BCE.\\nÆ Prutah (13mm, 2.02 gm, 12h).\\n\"Yehohanan the High Priest and the Council of the Jews\" (in Hebrew) in five lines within wreath / Double cornucopiae adorned with ribbons; pomegranate between horns; small A to lower left.\\nMeshorer Group B, 11; Hendin 457.\\nHe also outlawed observance of the Sabbath and the offering of sacrifices at the Jerusalem Temple and required Jewish leaders to sacrifice to idols; punitive executions were also instituted.\\nPossession of Jewish scriptures was made a capital offence.\\nThe motives of Antiochus are unclear.\\nHe may have been incensed at the overthrow of his appointee, Menelaus,[21] he may have been responding to a Jewish revolt that had drawn on the Temple and the Torah for its strength, or he may have been encouraged by a group of radical Hellenizers among the Jews.\\n[22]See also Antinomianism in the Books of the Maccabees.\\nMaccabean Revolt\\nMain article: Maccabean Revolt\\nThe author of the First Book of Maccabees regarded the Maccabean revolt as a rising of pious Jews against the Seleucid king who had tried to eradicate their religion and against the Jews who supported him.\\nThe author of the Second Book of Maccabees presented the conflict as a struggle between \"Judaism\" and \"Hellenism\", words that he was the first to use.\\n[22] Modern scholarship tends to the second view.\\nMost modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in a civil war between traditionalist Jews in the countryside and Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.\\n[23][24][25] According to Joseph P. Schultz, modern scholarship \"considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish camp.\"\\n[26] In the conflict over the office of High Priest, traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contested with Hellenizers with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.\\n[27] Other authors point to social and economic factors in the conflict.\\n[28][29] What began as a civil war took on the character of an invasion when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews against the traditionalists.\\n[30] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus prohibited the practices of the traditionalists, thereby, in a departure from usual Seleucid practice, banning the religion of an entire people.\\n[29] Other scholars argue that while the rising began as a religious rebellion, it was gradually transformed into a war of national liberation.\\n[31]The two most prominent 20th century scholars of the Maccabean revolt, Elias Bickermann and Victor Tcherikover, each have very different views for the cause of the revolt, focused on the policies of the Jewish leaders and not Antiochus IV:    \"Bickermann saw the origin of the problem in the attempt of \"Hellenized\" Jews to reform the \"antiquated\" and \"outdated\" religion practiced in Jerusalem, and to rid it of superstitious elements.\\nThey were the ones who egged on Antiochus IV and instituted the religious reform in Jerusalem.\\nOne suspects that [Bickermann] may have been influenced in his view by an antipathy to Reform Judaism in 19th- and 20th-century Germany.\\nTcherikover, perhaps influenced by socialist concerns, saw the uprising as one of the rural peasants against the rich elite.\\n[32]The descendants of Mattathias\\nAccording to I and II Maccabees, the priestly family of Mattathias (Mattisyahu/Mattitiyahu in Hebrew), which came to be known as the Maccabees,[33] called the people forth to holy war against the Seleucids.\\nMattathias\\' sons Judah (Yehuda), Jonathan (Yonoson/ Yonatan), and Simon (Shimon) began a military campaign, initially with disastrous results: one thousand Jewish men, women, and children were killed by Seleucid troops because they refused to fight, even in self-defense, on the Sabbath.\\nOther Jews then reasoned that they must fight when attacked, even on the Sabbath.\\nThe institution of guerrilla warfare practices by Judah over several years led to victory against the Seleucids:    \"It was now, in the fall of 165, that Judah\\'s successes began to disturb the central government.\\nHe appears to have controlled the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and thus to have cut off the royal party in Acra from direct communication with the sea and thus with the government.\\nIt is significant that this time the Syrian troops, under the leadership of the governor-general Lysias, took the southerly route, by way of Idumea.\\n\"[34]In 164 BC, Judah captured Jerusalem and the Temple in Jerusalem was freed and reconsecrated: \"After having recovered Jerusalem, Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the desecrated one, and new holy vessels to be made.\\n\"[35] The celebratory festival of Hanukkah is instituted: \"When the fire had been kindled anew upon the altar and the lamps of the candlestick lit, the dedication of the altar was celebrated for eight days amid sacrifices and songs.\\n\"[36]Antiochus IV died that same year, and was ultimately succeeded by Demetrius I Soter, the nephew whose throne he had usurped.\\nDemetrius sent the general Bacchides to Israel with a large army, in order to install Alcimus with the office of high priest.\\n[37] Bacchides subdued Jerusalem and returned to his King.\\n[38]From revolt to independence\\nJudah and Jonathan\\nPalestine under the Maccabees according to George Adam Smith\\nAfter five years of war and raids, Judah sought an alliance with the Roman Republic to remove the Greeks: \"In the year 161 BC he sent Eupolemus the son of Johanan and Jason the son of Eleazar, \\'to make a league of amity and confederacy with the Romans.\\'\\n\"[39]A Seleucid army under General Nicanor was defeated by Judah (ib.\\n7:26–50) at the Battle of Adasa, with Nicanor himself killed in action.\\nNext, Bacchides was sent with Alcimus and an army of twenty thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, and met Judah at the Battle of Elasa (Laisa), where this time it was the Hasmonean commander who was killed.\\n(161/160 BC).\\nBacchides now established the Hellenes as rulers in Israel; and upon Judah\\'s death, the persecuted patriots, under Jonathan, brother of Judah, fled beyond the Jordan River.\\n(ib.\\n9:25–27) They set camp near a morass by the name of Asphar, and remained, after several engagements with the Seleucids, in the swamp in the country east of the Jordan.\\nFollowing the death of his puppet governor Alcimus, High Priest of Jerusalem, Bacchides felt secure enough to leave the country, but two years after the departure of Bacchides from Israel, the City of Acre felt sufficiently threatened by Maccabee incursions to contact Demetrius and request the return of Bacchides to their territory.\\nJonathan and Simeon, now more experienced in guerilla warfare, thought it well to retreat farther, and accordingly fortified in the desert a place called Beth-hogla;[40] there they were besieged several days by Bacchides.\\nJonathan offered the rival general a peace treaty and exchange of prisoners of war.\\nBacchides readily consented and even took an oath of nevermore making war upon Jonathan.\\nHe and his forces then vacated Israel.\\nThe victorious Jonathan now took up his residence in the old city of Michmash.\\nFrom there he endeavored to clear the land of \"the godless and the apostate\".\\n[41] The chief source, 1 Maccabees, says that with this \"the sword ceased in Israel\", and in fact nothing is reported for the five following years (158–153 BC).\\nSeleucid civil conflict\\nAn important external event brought the design of the Maccabeans to fruition.\\nDemetrius I Soter\\'s relations with Attalus II Philadelphus of Pergamon (reigned 159–138 BC), Ptolemy VI of Egypt (reigned 163–145 BC), and Ptolemy\\'s co-ruler Cleopatra II of Egypt were deteriorating, and they supported a rival claimant to the Seleucid throne: Alexander Balas, who purported to be the son of Antiochus IV Epiphanes and a first cousin of Demetrius.\\nDemetrius was forced to recall the garrisons of Judea, except those in the City of Acre and at Beth-zur, to bolster his strength.\\nFurthermore, he made a bid for the loyalty of Jonathan, permitting him to recruit an army and to reclaim the hostages kept in the City of Acre.\\nJonathan gladly accepted these terms, took up residence at Jerusalem in 153 BC, and began fortifying the city.\\nAlexander Balas offered Jonathan even more favorable terms, including official appointment as High Priest in Jerusalem, and despite a second letter from Demetrius promising prerogatives that were almost impossible to guarantee,[42] Jonathan declared allegiance to Balas.\\nJonathan became the official leader of his people, and officiated at the Feast of Tabernacles of 153 BC wearing the High Priest\\'s garments.\\nThe Hellenistic party could no longer attack him without severe consequences.\\nSoon, Demetrius lost both his throne and his life, in 150 BC.\\nThe victorious Alexander Balas was given the further honor of marriage to Cleopatra Thea, daughter of his allies Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II.\\nJonathan was invited to Ptolemais for the ceremony, appearing with presents for both kings, and was permitted to sit between them as their equal; Balas even clothed him with his own royal garment and otherwise accorded him high honor.\\nBalas appointed Jonathan as strategos and \"meridarch\" (i.e., civil governor of a province; details not found in Josephus), sent him back with honors to Jerusalem,[43] and refused to listen to the Hellenistic party\\'s complaints against Jonathan.\\nHasmoneans under Balas and Demetrius IIIn 147 BC, Demetrius II Nicator, a son of Demetrius I Soter, claimed Balas\\' throne.\\nThe governor of Coele-Syria, Apollonius Taos, used the opportunity to challenge Jonathan to battle, saying that the Jews might for once leave the mountains and venture out into the plain.\\n[citation needed] Jonathan and Simeon led a force of 10,000 men against Apollonius\\' forces in Jaffa, which was unprepared for the rapid attack and opened the gates in surrender to the Jewish forces.\\nApollonius received reinforcements from Azotus and appeared in the plain in charge of 3,000 men including superior cavalry forces.\\nJonathan assaulted, captured and burned Azotus along with the resident temple of Dagon and the surrounding villages.\\nAlexander Balas honored the victorious High Priest by giving him the city of Ekron along with its outlying territory.\\nThe people of Azotus complained to King Ptolemy VI, who had come to make war upon his son-in-law, but Jonathan met Ptolemy at Jaffa in peace and accompanied him as far as the River Eleutherus.\\nJonathan then returned to Jerusalem, maintaining peace with the King of Egypt despite their support for different contenders for the Seleucid throne.\\n[44]Hasmoneans under Demetrius and Diodotus\\nIn 145 BC, the Battle of Antioch resulted in the final defeat of Alexander Balas by the forces of his father-in-law Ptolemy VI.\\nPtolemy himself, however, was among the casualties of the battle.\\nDemetrius II Nicator remained sole ruler of the Seleucid Empire and became the second husband of Cleopatra Thea.\\nJonathan owed no allegiance to the new King and took this opportunity to lay siege to the Acra, the Seleucid fortress in Jerusalem and the symbol of Seleucid control over Judea.\\nIt was heavily garrisoned by a Seleucid force and offered asylum to Jewish Hellenists.\\n[45] Demetrius was greatly incensed; he appeared with an army at Ptolemais and ordered Jonathan to come before him.\\nWithout raising the siege, Jonathan, accompanied by the elders and priests, went to the king and pacified him with presents, so that the king not only confirmed him in his office of high priest, but gave to him the three Samaritan toparchies of Mount Ephraim, Lod, and Ramathaim-Zophim.\\nIn consideration of a present of 300 talents the entire country was exempted from taxes, the exemption being confirmed in writing.\\nJonathan in return lifted the siege of the Acra and left it in Seleucid hands.\\nSoon, however, a new claimant to the Seleucid throne appeared in the person of the young Antiochus VI Dionysus, son of Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea.\\nHe was three years old at most, but general Diodotus Tryphon used him to advance his own designs on the throne.\\nIn the face of this new enemy, Demetrius not only promised to withdraw the garrison from the City of Acre, but also called Jonathan his ally and requested him to send troops.\\nThe 3,000 men of Jonathan protected Demetrius in his capital, Antioch, against his own subjects.\\n[46]As Demetrius II did not keep his promise, Jonathan thought it better to support the new king when Diodotus Tryphon and Antiochus VI seized the capital, especially as the latter confirmed all his rights and appointed his brother Simon (Simeon) strategos of the Paralia (the seacoast), from the \"Ladder of Tyre\" to the frontier of Egypt.\\n[47]Jonathan and Simon were now entitled to make conquests; Ashkelon submitted voluntarily while Gaza was forcibly taken.\\nJonathan vanquished even the strategoi of Demetrius II far to the north, in the plain of Hazar, while Simon at the same time took the strong fortress of Beth-zur on the pretext that it harbored supporters of Demetrius.\\n[48]Like Judah in former years, Jonathan sought alliances with foreign peoples.\\nHe renewed the treaty with the Roman Republic and exchanged friendly messages with Sparta and other places.\\nHowever, one should note that the documents referring to those diplomatic events are of questionable authenticity.\\nDiodotus Tryphon went with an army to Judea and invited Jonathan to Scythopolis for a friendly conference, where he persuaded him to dismiss his army of 40,000 men, promising to give him Ptolemais and other fortresses.\\nJonathan fell into the trap; he took with him to Ptolemais 1,000 men, all of whom were slain; he himself was taken prisoner.\\n[49]Simon assumes leadership\\nWhen Diodotus Tryphon was about to enter Judea at Hadid, he was confronted by the new Jewish leader, Simon, ready for battle.\\nTrypho, avoiding an engagement, demanded one hundred talents and Jonathan\\'s two sons as hostages, in return for which he promised to liberate Jonathan.\\nAlthough Simon did not trust Diodotus Tryphon, he complied with the request so that he might not be accused of the death of his brother.\\nBut Diodotus Tryphon did not liberate his prisoner; angry that Simon blocked his way everywhere and that he could accomplish nothing, he executed Jonathan at Baskama, in the country east of the Jordan.\\n[50] Jonathan was buried by Simeon at Modin.\\nNothing is known of his two captive sons.\\nOne of his daughters was an ancestor of Josephus.\\n[51]Simon assumed the leadership (142 BC), receiving the double office of High Priest and prince of Israel.\\nThe leadership of the Hasmoneans was established by a resolution, adopted in 141 BC, at a large assembly \"of the priests and the people and of the elders of the land, to the effect that Simon should be their leader and High Priest forever, until there should arise a faithful prophet\" (1 Macc.\\n14:41).\\nIronically, the election was performed in Hellenistic fashion.\\nSimon, having made the Jewish people semi-independent of the Seleucid Greeks, reigned from 142 to 135 BC and formed the Hasmonean dynasty.\\nThe Roman Senate accorded the new dynasty recognition by the Romans c.?\\n139 BC, when the delegation of Simon was in Rome.\\nSimon led the people in peace and prosperity, until in February 135 BC, he was assassinated at the instigation of his son-in-law Ptolemy, son of Abubus (also spelled Abobus or Abobi), who had been named governor of the region by the Seleucids.\\nSimon\\'s eldest sons, Mattathias and Judah, were also murdered.\\nHasmonean expansion and civil war\\nKingdom at its greatest extent under Salome Alexandra\\nIn c.?\\n135 BC, John Hyrcanus, Simon\\'s third son, assumed the leadership and ruled as high priest (Kohen Gadol) and took a Greek \"regnal name\" (see Hyrcania) in an acceptance of the Hellenistic culture of his Seleucid suzerains.\\nWithin a year of the death of Simon, Seleucid King Antiochus VII Sidetes attacked Jerusalem.\\nAccording to Josephus,[52] John Hyrcanus opened King David\\'s sepulchre and removed three thousand talents which he paid as tribute to spare the city.\\nHe remained as governor as a Seleucid vassal.\\nFor the next two decades of his reign, Hyrcanus continued, like his father, to rule semi-autonomously from the Seleucids.\\nThe Seleucid empire had been disintegrating in the face of the Seleucid–Parthian wars and in 129 BC Antiochus VII Sidetes was killed in Media by the forces of Phraates II of Parthia, permanently ending Seleucid rule east of the Euphrates.\\nIn 116 BC, a civil war between Seleucid half-brothers Antiochus VIII Grypus and Antiochus IX Cyzicenus broke out, resulting in a further breakup of the already significantly reduced kingdom.\\nThis provided opportunity for semi-independent Seleucid client states such as Judea to revolt.\\n[53][54][55] In 110 BC, John Hyrcanus carried out the first military conquests of the newly independent Hasmonean kingdom, raising a mercenary army to capture Madaba and Schechem, significantly increasing his regional influence[56][57]Hyrcanus conquered Transjordan, Samaria, Galilee, and Idumea (also known as Edom), and forced Idumeans to convert to Judaism:    \"Hyrcanus...subdued all the Idumeans; and permitted them to stay in that country, if they would circumcise their genitals, and make use of the laws of the Jews; and they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers, that they submitted to the use of circumcision, (25) and of the rest of the Jewish ways of living; at which time therefore this befell them, that they were hereafter no other than Jews.\\n\"[58]He desired that his wife succeed him as head of the government, with his eldest of five sons, Aristobulus I, becoming only the high-priest.\\nAristobulus was the first Hasmonean to take the title basileus, asserting the new-found independence of the state.\\nUpon Hyrcanus\\' death, however, Aristobulus jailed his mother and three brothers, including Alexander Jannaeus, and allowed her to starve there.\\nBy this means he came into possession of the throne, but died one year later after a painful illness in 103 BC.\\nAristobulus\\' brothers were freed from prison by his widow; Alexander reigned from 103–76 BC, and died during the siege of the fortress Ragaba.\\nIn c.?\\n87 BC, according to Josephus, following a six-year civil war involving Seleucid king Demetrius III Eucaerus, Hasmonean ruler Alexander Jannaeus crucified 800 Jewish rebels in Jerusalem.\\nAlexander was followed by his wife, Salome Alexandra, who reigned from 76–67 BC.\\nShe was the only regnant Jewish Queen.\\nDuring her reign, her son Hyrcanus II held the office of High Priest and was named her successor.\\nPharisee and Sadducee factions\\nIt is difficult to state at what time the Pharisees, as a party, arose.\\nJosephus first mentions them in connection with Jonathan, the successor of Judas Maccabeus (\"Ant.\\n\" xiii.\\n5, § 9).\\nOne of the factors that distinguished the Pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the Temple was their belief that all Jews had to observe the purity laws (which applied to the Temple service) outside the Temple.\\nThe major difference, however, was the continued adherence of the Pharisees to the laws and traditions of the Jewish people in the face of assimilation.\\nAs Josephus noted, the Pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of Jewish law.\\nDuring the Hasmonean period, the Sadducees and Pharisees functioned primarily as political parties.\\nAlthough the Pharisees had opposed the wars of expansion of the Hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the Idumeans, the political rift between them became wider when Pharisees demanded that the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus choose between being king and being High Priest.\\nIn response, the king openly sided with the Sadducees by adopting their rites in the Temple.\\nHis actions caused a riot in the Temple and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees, although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties.\\nAlexander was succeeded by his widow, Salome Alexandra, whose brother was Shimon ben Shetach, a leading Pharisee.\\nUpon her death her elder son, Hyrcanus, sought Pharisee support, and her younger son, Aristobulus, sought the support of the Sadducees.\\nThe conflict between Hyrcanus and Aristobulus culminated in a civil war that ended when the Roman general Pompey captured Jerusalem in 63 BC and inaugurated the Roman period of Jewish history.\\nJosephus attests that Salome Alexandra was very favorably inclined toward the Pharisees and that their political influence grew tremendously under her reign, especially in the institution known as the Sanhedrin.\\nLater texts such as the Mishnah and the Talmud record a host of rulings ascribed to the Pharisees concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the Temple, torts, criminal law, and governance.\\nThe influence of the Pharisees over the lives of the common people remained strong, and their rulings on Jewish law were deemed authoritative by many.\\nAlthough these texts were written long after these periods, many scholars believe that they are a fairly reliable account of history during the Second Temple era.\\nCivil war\\nAlexander Jannaeus\\' son, Hyrcanus II, had scarcely reigned three months when his younger brother, Aristobulus II, rose in rebellion, whereupon Hyrcanus advanced against him at the head of an army of mercenaries and his Pharisee followers: \"NOW Hyrcanus was heir to the kingdom, and to him did his mother commit it before she died; but Aristobulus was superior to him in power and magnanimity; and when there was a battle between them, to decide the dispute about the kingdom, near Jericho, the greatest part deserted Hyrcanus, and went over to Aristobulus.\\n\"[59]Hyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of Jerusalem, but the capture of the Temple by Aristobulus II compelled Hyrcanus to surrender.\\nA peace was then concluded, according to the terms of which Hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest (comp.\\nSchürer, \"Gesch.\\n\" i. 291, note 2), but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office: \"but Hyrcanus, with those of his party who stayed with him, fled to Antonia, and got into his power the hostages (which were Aristobulus\\'s wife, with her children) that he might persevere; but the parties came to an agreement before things should come to extremes, that Aristobulus should be king, and Hyrcanus should resign, but retain all the rest of his dignities, as being the king\\'s brother.\\nHereupon they were reconciled to each other in the Temple, and embraced one another in a very kind manner, while the people stood round about them; they also changed their houses, while Aristobulus went to the royal palace, and Hyrcanus retired to the house of Aristobulus.\\n\"[59] Aristobulus ruled from 67–63 BC).\\nFrom 63–40 BC, the government was in the hands of Hyrcanus II as High Priest and Ethnarch, although effective power was in the hands of his adviser Antipater the Idumaean.\\nIntrigues of Antipater\\nThe struggle would have ended here but for Antipater the Idumean.\\nAntipater saw clearly that it would be easier to reach the object of his ambition, the control of Judea, under the government of the weak Hyrcanus than under the warlike and energetic Aristobulus.\\nHe accordingly began to impress upon Hyrcanus\\' mind that Aristobulus was planning his death, finally persuading him to take refuge with Aretas, king of the Nabatæans.\\nAretas, bribed by Antipater, who also promised him the restitution of the Arabian towns taken by the Hasmoneans, readily espoused the cause of Hyrcanus and advanced toward Jerusalem with an army of fifty thousand.\\nDuring the siege, which lasted several months, the adherents of Hyrcanus were guilty of two acts that greatly incensed the majority of the Jews: they stoned the pious Onias (see Honi ha-Magel) and, instead of a lamb which the besieged had bought of the besiegers for the purpose of the paschal sacrifice, sent a pig.\\nHoni, ordered to curse the besieged, prayed: \"Lord of the universe, as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to Thy people, I beseech Thee not to answer the evil prayers of either.\\n\" The pig incident is derived from rabbinical sources.\\nAccording to Josephus, the besiegers kept the enormous price of one thousand drachmas they had asked for the lamb.\\nRoman intervention\\nPompey the Great\\nPompey in the Temple of Jerusalem, by Jean Fouquet\\nWhile this civil war was going on the Roman general Marcus Aemilius Scaurus went to Syria to take possession, in the name of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, of the kingdom of the Seleucids.\\nThe brothers appealed to him, each endeavoring by gifts and promises to win him over to his side.\\nAt first Scaurus, moved by a gift of four hundred talents, decided in favor of Aristobulus.\\nAretas was ordered to withdraw his army from Judea, and while retreating suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Aristobulus.\\nBut when Pompey came to Syria (63 BC), a different situation arose.\\nPompey, who had just been awarded the title \"Conqueror of Asia\" due to his decisive victories in Asia Minor over Pontus and the Seleucid Empire, had decided to bring Judea under the rule of the Romans.\\nHe took the same view of Hyrcanus\\' ability, and was moved by much the same motives as Antipater: as a ward of Rome, Hyrcanus would be more acceptable than Aristobulus.\\nWhen, therefore, the brothers, as well as delegates of the people\\'s party, which, weary of Hasmonean quarrels, desired the extinction of the dynasty, presented themselves before Pompey, he delayed the decision, in spite of Aristobulus\\' gift of a golden vine valued at five hundred talents.\\nThe latter, however, fathomed the designs of Pompey, and assembled his armies.\\nPompey defeated him multiple times however and captured his cities.\\nAristobulus II entrenched himself in the fortress of Alexandrium; but, soon realizing the uselessness of resistance, surrendered at the first summons of the Romans, and undertook to deliver Jerusalem to them.\\nThe patriots, however, were not willing to open their gates to the Romans, and a siege ensued which ended with the capture of the city.\\nPompey entered the Holy of Holies; this was only the second time that someone had dared to penetrate into this sacred spot.\\nJudaea had to pay tribute to Rome and was placed under the supervision of the Roman governor of Syria:    \"In 63 BC, Judaea became a protectorate of Rome.\\nComing under the administration of a governor, Judaea was allowed a king; the governor\\'s business was to regulate trade and maximize tax revenue.\\n\"[60]In 57–55 BC, Aulus Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into Galilee, Samaria, and Judea, with five districts of legal and religious councils known as sanhedrin (Greek: s???\\nd????\\n, \"synedrion\"): \"And when he had ordained five councils (s???\\nd??\\na), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts.\\nSo these councils governed the people; the first was at Jerusalem, the second at Gadara, the third at Amathus, the fourth at Jericho, and the fifth at Sepphoris in Galilee.\\n\"[61][62]Pompey and Caesar\\nJulius Caesar initially supported Aristobulus against Hyrcanus and Antipater.\\nBetween the weakness of Hyrcanus and the ambition of Aristobulus, Judea lost its independence.\\nAristobulus was taken to Rome a prisoner, and Hyrcanus was reappointed High Priest, but without political authority.\\nWhen, in 50 BC, it appeared that Julius Caesar was interested in using Aristobulus and his family as his clients to take control of Judea from Hyrcanus and Antipater, who were beholden to Pompey, supporters of Pompey had Aristobulus poisoned in Rome and executed Alexander in Antioch.\\nHowever, Pompey\\'s pawns soon had occasion to turn to the other side:    \"At the beginning of the civil war between [Caesar] and Pompey, Hyrcanus, at the instance of Antipater, prepared to support the man to whom he owed his position; but when Pompey was murdered, Antipater led the Jewish forces to the help of Caesar, who was hard pressed at Alexandria.\\nHis timely help and his influence over the Egyptian Jews recommended him to Caesar\\'s favor, and secured for him an extension of his authority in Palestine, and for Hyrcanus the confirmation of his ethnarchy.\\nJoppa was restored to the Hasmonean domain, Judea was granted freedom from all tribute and taxes to Rome, and the independence of the internal administration was guaranteed.\\n\"[63]The timely aid from Antipater and Hyrcanus led the triumphant Caesar to ignore the claims of Aristobulus\\'s younger son, Antigonus the Hasmonean, and to confirm Hyrcanus and Antipater in their authority, despite their previous allegiance to Pompey.\\nJosephus noted,    \"Antigonus... came to Caesar... and accused Hyrcanus and Antipater, how they had driven him and his brethren entirely out of their native country... and that as to the assistance they had sent [to Caesar] into Egypt, it was not done out of good-will to him, but out of the fear they were in from former quarrels, and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to [his enemy] Pompey.\\n\"[64]Hyrcanus\\' restoration as ethnarch in 47 BC coincided with Caesar\\'s appointment of Antipater as the first Roman Procurator, allowing Antipater to promote the interests of his own house: \"Caesar appointed Hyrcanus to be high priest, and gave Antipater what principality he himself should choose, leaving the determination to himself; so he made him procurator of Judea.\\n\"[65]Antipater appointed his sons to positions of influence: Phasael became Governor of Jerusalem, and Herod Governor of Galilee.\\nThis led to increasing tension between Hyrcanus and the family of Antipater, culminating in a trial of Herod for supposed abuses in his governorship, which resulted in Herod\\'s flight into exile in 46 BC.\\nHerod soon returned, however, and the honors to Antipater\\'s family continued.\\nHyrcanus\\' incapacity and weakness were so manifest that, when he defended Herod against the Sanhedrin and before Mark Antony, the latter stripped Hyrcanus of his nominal political authority and his title, bestowing them both upon the accused.\\nCaesar was assassinated in 44 BC and unrest and confusion spread throughout the Roman world, including Judaea.\\nAntipater the Idumean was assassinated by a rival, Malichus, in 43 BC, but Antipater\\'s sons managed to kill Malichus and maintain their control over Judea and their father\\'s puppet Hasmonean, Hyrcanus.\\nParthian invasion, Antony, Augustus\\nThe taking of Jerusalem by Herod the Great, 36 BC (sic)Parthian Empire at its greatest extent, c.?\\n60 BCAfter Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 BC, Quintus Labienus, a Roman republican general and ambassador to the Parthians, sided with Brutus and Cassius in the Liberators\\' civil war; after their defeat Labienus joined the Parthians and assisted them in invading Roman territories in 40 BC.\\nThe Parthian army crossed the Euphrates and Labienus was able to entice Mark Antony\\'s Roman garrisons around Syria to rally to his cause.\\nThe Parthians split their army, and under Pacorus conquered the Levant from the Phoenician coast through the Land of Israel:    \"Antigonus... roused the Parthians to invade Syria and Palestine, [and] the Jews eagerly rose in support of the scion of the Maccabean house, and drove out the hated Idumeans with their puppet Jewish king.\\nThe struggle between the people and the Romans had begun in earnest, and though Antigonus, when placed on the throne by the Parthians, proceeded to spoil and harry the Jews, rejoicing at the restoration of the Hasmonean line, thought a new era of independence had come.\\n[66]When Phasael and Hyrcanus II set out on an embassy to the Parthians, the Parthians instead captured them.\\nAntigonus, who was present, cut off Hyrcanus\\'s ears to make him unsuitable for the High Priesthood, while Phasael was put to death.\\nAntigonus, whose Hebrew name was Mattathias, bore the double title of king and High Priest for only three years, as he had not disposed of Herod, the most dangerous of his enemies.\\nHerod fled into exile and sought the support of Mark Antony.\\nHerod was designated \"King of the Jews\" by the Roman Senate in 40 BC: Antony    \"then resolved to get [Herod] made king of the Jews...[and] told [the Senate] that it was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod should be king; so they all gave their votes for it.\\nAnd when the senate was separated, Antony and Caesar [Augustus] went out, with Herod between them; while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them, in order to offer sacrifices [to the Roman gods], and to lay the decree in the Capitol.\\nAntony also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign.\"\\n[67]The struggle thereafter lasted for some years, as the main Roman forces were occupied with defeating the Parthians and had few additional resources to use to support Herod.\\nAfter the Parthians\\' defeat, Herod was victorious over his rival in 37 BC.\\nAntigonus was delivered to Antony and executed shortly thereafter.\\nThe Romans assented to Herod\\'s proclamation as King of the Jews, bringing about the end of the Hasmonean rule over Judea.\\nHerod and the end of the dynasty\\nAntigonus was not, however, the last Hasmonean.\\nThe fate of the remaining male members of the family under Herod was not a happy one.\\nAristobulus III, grandson of Aristobulus II through his elder son Alexander, was briefly made high priest, but was soon executed (36 BC) due to Herod\\'s jealousy.\\nHis sister Mariamne was married to Herod, but fell victim to his notorious jealousy.\\nHer sons by Herod, Aristobulus IV and Alexander, were in their adulthood also executed by their father.\\nHyrcanus II had been held by the Parthians since 40 BC.\\nFor four years, until 36 BC, he lived amid the Babylonian Jews, who paid him every mark of respect.\\nIn that year Herod, who feared that Hyrcanus might induce the Parthians to help him regain the throne, invited him to return to Jerusalem.\\nThe Babylonian Jews warned him in vain.\\nHerod received him with every mark of respect, assigning him the first place at his table and the presidency of the state council, while awaiting an opportunity to get rid of him.\\nAs the last remaining Hasmonean, Hyrcanus was too dangerous a rival for Herod.\\nIn the year 30 BC, charged with plotting with the King of Arabia, Hyrcanus was condemned and executed.\\nThe later Herodian rulers Agrippa I and Agrippa II both had Hasmonean blood, as Agrippa I\\'s father was Aristobulus IV, son of Herod by Mariamne I, but they were not direct male descendants, unless Herod was understood as a Hasmonean as per the following synthesis:According to Josephus, Herod was also of Maccabean descent:    Eleazar Maccabeus called Auran brother of Judas Maccabeus {Josephus Antiquity of the Jews Book XII/Chapter 9/Section 4}    Jason son of Eleazar {Ditto: Book XII/Chapter 10/Section 6}    Antipater I son of Jason {Ditto: Book XIII/Chapter 5/Section 8}    Antipater II Antipas son of Antipater I {Ditto: Book XIV/Chapter 1/Section 3}    Herod\\nLegacy and scholarship\\nWhile the Hasmonean dynasty managed to create an independent Jewish kingdom, its successes were rather short-lived, and the dynasty by and large failed to live up to the nationalistic momentum the Maccabee brothers had gained.\\nJewish nationalism\\nThe fall of the Hasmonean Kingdom marked an end to a century of Jewish self-governance, but Jewish nationalism and desire for independence continued under Roman rule, beginning with the Census of Quirinius in 6 and leading to a series of Jewish-Roman wars in the 1st–2nd centuries, including the Great Revolt (AD 66–73), the Kitos War (115–117), and Bar Kokhba\\'s revolt (132–135).\\nDuring the wars, temporary commonwealths were established, but they ultimately fell to the sustained might of Rome.\\nRoman legions under Vespasian and Titus besieged and destroyed Jerusalem, looted and burned Herod\\'s Temple (in the year 70) and Jewish strongholds (notably Gamla in 67 and Masada in 73), and enslaved or massacred a large part of the Jewish population.\\nThe defeat of the Jewish revolts against the Roman Empire notably contributed to the numbers and geography of the Jewish Diaspora, as many Jews were scattered after losing their state or were sold into slavery throughout the empire.\\nJewish religious scholarship\\nJewish tradition holds that the claiming of kingship by the later Hasmoneans led to their eventual downfall, since that title was only to be held by descendants of the line of King David.\\nThe Hasmonean bureaucracy was filled with men with Greek names, and the dynasty eventually became very Hellenized, to the annoyance of many of its more traditionally-minded Jewish subjects.\\nFrequent dynastic quarrels also contributed to the view among Jews of later generations that the latter Hasmoneans were degenerate.\\nOne member of this school was Josephus, whose accounts are in many cases our sole source of information about the Hasmoneans.\\nHasmonean leaders\\nMaccabees1.\\nMattathias, 170–167 BC2.\\nJudas Maccabeus, 167–160

Numismatics); it is therefore not certain that they were struck by Simon, and Schürer is particularly disinclined to ascribe them to his reign (\"Gesch.\"\\n3d ed., i. 243, 761 et seq.).\\nSimon was still confronted with the task of securing his position in the country.\\nHe therefore laid siege to the old and powerful city of Gazara and captured it, after which he expelled the pagan inhabitants, removed the idols from the houses, purified the city, and \"placed such men there as would keep the Law\" (I Macc.\\nxiii.\\n43-48; comp.\\nxiv.\\n34; \"Ant.\"\\nxiii.\\n6, § 7; Strabo, p. 759).\\nHe then attacked the last bulwark of the Syrians in Judea, the Acra of Jerusalem, which was taken on the 23d day of the second month, 142 B.C., and entered by the Jews chanting hymns of thanksgiving to the sound of harps, and bearing palm-branches (I Macc.\\nxiii.\\n49-52; comp.\\nxiv.\\n7, 36, 37; \"Ant.\"\\nl.c.).\\nMerited punishment was visited on the Hellenists (called \"children of the Acra\" in Meg.\\nTa\\'an.\\n§ 2), both in the capital and throughout the country.\\nIn this connection, although the actual work was probably done at a later time, Josephus speaks (\"Ant.\"\\nl.c.; comp.\\n\"B. J.\" v. 4, § 1) of the laborious demolition of the citadel, which took three years.\\nIt is hardly likely that the fortifications were permitted during this time to command the Temple, yet they must have remained standing, for Simon is said to have garrisoned them (I Macc.\\nxiv.\\n37; comp.\\nxv.\\n28).\\nAt the same time he placed his son John, who resided at Gazara, in charge of a portion of the army (ib.\\nxiii.\\n53).\\nAlliance with Rome.\\nThe country now enjoyed a lasting peace, and the author of the First Book of Maccabees (xiv.\\n8-15) describes the felicity of the people in glowing colors, adhering closely to the accounts of the blessings promised in the Bible, and carefully including Simon\\'s services to religion.\\nHe then speaks of the honor shown the Jewish people by other nations, declaring (xiv.\\n16-19) that the Romans renewed their friendship with the Jews on their own initiative (although this is improbable), and that the Spartans, at the request of the Jews, made a documentary declaration of their friendship (xiv.\\n20-23).\\nWillrich regards this record as spurious, like others of a similar nature.\\nThe statement (xiv.\\n24) that Simon sought to win the favor of the Romans by rich gifts through the agency of Numenius is apparently incorrect, for the friendship of Rome has already been noted in a previous passage.\\nAn alliance (\"amicitia\") between the Romans and the Jews is, however, mentioned in other sources (Justin, \"Apologia,\" xxxvi.\\n3, § 9).\\nHereditary Prince.\\nThe high esteem in which Simon was held by foreign powers impelled the people to show their appreciation of him, and on Elul 18, 141 B.C., the assembly of the priests, the people, the leaders of the people, and the elders of the land resolved that Simon should be the high priest, strategus, and ethnarch of the Jews, \"forever, until there should arise a faithful prophet\" (I Macc.\\nxiv.\\n41).\\nBy this phrase they probably intended to imply that the time would come when the spirit of prophecy would again appear in Israel, enabling them to learn the will of God; or they may have meant to express their conviction that the prophet Elijah would announce the Messiah, who would belong to the house of David, and in that case there could, of course, be no ruler but him.\\nThis resolution was inscribed upon brass tablets and set up in the court of the Temple.\\nAccording to Willrich, this record can not have been quoted in the original text of the Maccabees, since the inscription states that Simon sent his deputation to Rome before he was recognized by Demetrius, and regards the Roman alliance as the motive for this confirmation, whereas xiv.\\n3 asserts that Demetrius was taken prisoner by the Parthians before the embassy went to Rome; furthermore, Numenius is said (xv.\\n15) to have returned in 139-138, when Antiochus Sidetes was already on the throne.\\nWhether the inscription is authentic or not, it is at least certain that Simon bequeathed his dignities to his children, and thus became the founder of the Hasmonean dynasty.\\nWar with the Syrians.\\nOnce more Simon became involved in the Syrian imbroglio.\\nAntiochus VII.\\n(Sidetes), the brother of the captive Demetrius, attempted to seize the throne of Syria; in a letter written at Rhodes, before he landed on the Asiatic coast, he confirmed Simon in all the privileges granted him by previous kings, especially in the prerogative of coinage (I Macc.\\nxv.\\n1-9), although this was apparently a mere sanction of the actual state of affairs.\\nBut as soon as Antiochus felt secure from Trypho he changed his attitude.\\nAt the siege of Dora he rejected the reenforcements sent by Simon, and demanded either that Simon should surrender Joppa, Gazara, and the Acra, which, he alleged, had been wrongfully taken by the Jews, or that he should pay an indemnity of one thousand talents.\\nThe result was a war in which the Syrians under Cendebeus were defeated by Simon\\'s sons Judah and John (136 B.C.).\\nThe age of Simon had led him to entrust this war to his sons, but the hope which he may have cherished, that in his old age at least he would be able to enjoy the reward of his deeds, was doomed to disappointment.\\nIn 135 B.C. Simon, the last of the Maccabean brothers, died by violence.\\nAccording to his custom, he was traveling through the country holding court, when, in the fortress of Docus, near Jericho, he and his sons Mattathias and Judah were slain by his son-in-law Ptolemeus at a banquet prepared by the last-mentioned (I Macc.\\nxvi.\\n11-17; \"Ant.\"\\nxiii.\\n7, § 4).\\nThe seven short years of his reign prepared the way for the events of the following one hundred years.\\nHe was succeeded by his son John Hyrcanus I.']"

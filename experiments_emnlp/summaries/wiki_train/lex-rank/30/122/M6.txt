Bruce Castle Museum We are most fortunate in Tottenham to have the wonderful facilities of Bruce Castle Museum to help us with both Family History and Local History projects.
An Early illustration of Bruce Castle House The 'Round Tower' Bruce Castle Museum and Park Sir Rowland Hill's family ran a progressive school for boys at Bruce Castle during the Victorian period.
Bruce Castle opened as a Museum in 1906 and now houses the Borough of Haringey's local history collections and archives.
There are also two local groups who help further the work of the Museum and support local History projects in the Borough.
Haringey Local History Forum who are dedicated to preserve and enlarge its knowledge of Haringey and surrounding districts.
The aims of the society are to educate the public in the geography, history, natural history and architecture of Tottenham.

acknowledge the help and support provided by the Museum staff in the development of our 'Summerhill Road' website which has been invaluable.

Sir Phillip Hoby)Associated with: Anne STAFFORD (C. Huntingdon)When Henry VIII ascended to the throne in 1509, he handed the Manor of Wooburn to his friend Sir William Compton, Chief Ranger of Windsor Great Park.
Don Luis Caroz, the Spanish Ambassador, reported, on 28 May 1510, that one of the young, married sisters of the Duke of Buckingham had attracted the attention of King Henry VIII.
Perhaps because Compton was no fit paramour for a duke's sister it was thought that he was acting on Henry's behalf.
Anne was carried off by her husband to the safety of a nunnery.
Not only did he founded a chantry where prayers were said daily for her soul and those of his family members, but also the profits from certain of his lands in Leicestershire were earmarked for her use for the remainder of her life.
The latest theories are that the original purpose of the Round Tower was a hawk mews, used for keeping birds of prey for the medieval sport of falconry.
There are records that Henry VIII had a meeting with his sister Margaret, Queen of Scotland, at Bruce Castle in 1516.
Compton lived at Wooburn Manor and left it to his son Peter, a ward of Cardinal Wolsey.

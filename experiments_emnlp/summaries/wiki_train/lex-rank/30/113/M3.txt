A monk was waiting for us in front of five beautiful stone statues, which were displayed in a bank of water.
The monk introduced himself before giving us a brief introduction to Buddhism.
He showed us structures that represented different stages in the Buddha's quest for Enlightenment.
There was a stone statue of a starving Buddha and another of the Buddha after he had found a balance.
The day wasn't over yet...
After visiting the monastery, we visited Borobudur Temple, which is a Mahayana Buddhist temple from the 9th Century.
Certain parts of the temple had been buried for thousands of years due to the volcanic ashes.
It was only in 1814 that it was re-discovered.
The temple was not too tall but it was extremely wide.
For example, on the first level which is that of desire, there were stories about gossip, prostitution and alcohol.
Our tour guide took us to each level and explained some of the stories.
It was interesting to learn about the same religion, but in two different scenarios.
The temple was quiet and serene whereas Borobudur was a historic landsite that was bursting with people.

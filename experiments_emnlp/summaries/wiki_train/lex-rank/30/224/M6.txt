Rumors of gold in California had existed for years before the Gold Rush.
But it wasn't until gold was discovered at Sutter's mill that the Gold Rush began.
He became a Mexican citizen and received a land grant of 50,000 acres in Sacramento Valley.
On January 4, 1848, James Marshall picked up a piece of metal at the mill that looked like gold.
He asked Marshall and the others working at the mill to keep the gold a secret.
The discovery of gold in California became national news.

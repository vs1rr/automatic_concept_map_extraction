However, by the end of this period these invaders had established themselves in the Balkans.
Bulgars, Slavs & Avars 500-600New barbarian tribes, the Bulgars and the Slavs were pushed south into the Balkans by the Avars.
Despite reverses such as Sardica (Sofia) in 550 they occupied most of the Balkans by the end of the century.
The Avars were heavy bow armed cavalry who after initially being paid by Justinian to attack the Slavs, allied themselves with the Balkan Slavs, Gepids and Bulgars to ravage the Balkans.
Byzantine Empire 602-800The Byzantine Empire spent the 7th Century on the defensive in the Balkans while it fought most of its wars in the East resisting Sassanid and then Arab invasions.
The 9th Century Bulgars under Khan Krum raided westwards into Croatia and Serbia as well as southwards.
His second son Symeon (893-927) fought a series of wars with the Byzantine Empire gaining Macedonia, Thessaly and Albania.
He finally brought Serbia under Bulgar control in 918, although he failed in Croatia.
Byzantine Emperor Basil II returned from his difficulties with the Arabs to capture Eastern Bulgaria and then defeating Samuel at Spercheios 996 recovering Greece and Macedonia.
The Magyars The Magyars (or Hungarians) were the last steppe peoples to settle in the Balkans.
The Magyars were driven from the steppe by the Pechenegs3 and established themselves in Hungary from 899 under their chieftain Arpad, driving the Slavs south out of the Danube valley.
For more than a century they invaded Northern Italy, Germany and France until their decisive defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.
SerbiaThe Slav tribes West of the Bulgars known as Serbs coalesced as a state in the 9th Century.
The new state fought off the growing strength of Venice and although Slavonia was overrun by the Magyars, Duke Tomislav held them off establishing the Kingdom of the Croats in 925.

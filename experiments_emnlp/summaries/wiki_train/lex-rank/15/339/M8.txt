His contributions to the independence movement were restricted to Orange County, however, until his election to the Virginia Convention of 1776.
Madison was among those who thought that the Confederation government needed to be invested with more power at the expense of the states.
Before he took up the task of reformulating the American system of government in 1787, Madison left national office to serve in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1784 and for the two subsequent years.
Madison was again elected as a Virginia delegate to Congress, arriving in New York in February 1787.
These were collected and published in 1788 as The Federalist.
In March 1788, Madison returned home for election to the Virginia ratifying convention, where he ably defended the Philadelphia convention's handiwork, helping Virginia to became the tenth state to ratify the Constitution.
Madison further felt that Hamilton was breaching the limits of power of the federal government as designed in the Constitutional Convention.
In December 1798, at Jefferson's urging, he drafted the Virginia Resolutions, which called on the states to protest the infringement of their rights and liberties by the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts and generally criticized the enlargement of federal powers that had taken place in the previous five years.
Throughout his first term Madison was preoccupied by disputes with France, Great Britain, and Spain.
In June 1812 he asked for and received a declaration of war against Great Britain.
The Second Bank of the United States was established by Madison's signature in 1816, but in one of his last official acts he vetoed as unconstitutional a Bonus Bill that provided for federal support of roads and canals.
He retired to Montpelier for the second, and last, time in March 1817.

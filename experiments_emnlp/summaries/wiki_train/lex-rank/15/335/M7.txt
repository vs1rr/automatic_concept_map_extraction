Iâ€™ve always been intrigued with the Pendle story and wanted to look at it closer and, through doing this, A Pendle Investigation developed.
I get this all the time, people judge me instantly
and it seemed to be the same with the witches, that people judged them for being different.
Iâ€™m not saying that people donâ€™t accept me, but that people like to put other people in boxes.
I donâ€™t think I was fully prepared for the way it affected me.
I was on my own for long periods of time and it was a very powerful experience.
People up to now have been really moved with the work, more so if they know the story, but I hope a connection is made with the images even if they donâ€™t.

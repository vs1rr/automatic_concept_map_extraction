'THE PENDLE WITCHES' BY CHRISTINE GOODIER MAOn August 20th 1612 ten people convicted of witchcraft at the Summer Assize held in Lancaster Castle went to the gallows on the moors above the town.
Among their number were two men and a woman in her eighties.
THE PENDLE ACCUSED AND THEIR CRIMESThe most famous of the Pendle witches actually died before coming to trial.
Also implicated were members of both their families: Elizabeth Device, Demdike's daughter, was accused of two murders, as was her son James, while Alison was to stand trial for what she had done to John Law on that fateful spring day five months before.
Others were dragged into the affair: John and Jane Bulcock, a mother and her son, were tried for causing madness, and for being at a so-called Witches Sabbath held at Malkin Tower on Good Friday 1612; Alice Nutter from Roughlee Hall, was accused of killing one Henry Mitton because he refused to give Demdike a penny; Margaret Pearson was accused of bewitching one of her neighbour's horses to death, and Katherine Hewitt was accused of the murder of Ann Foulds.
Elizabeth Device followed her into court.
Her evidence was devastating, and Elizabeth was so overcome with anger that she had to be removed from court.
However, there was little sympathy for him and after more hearsay evidence, and his own testimony, he was found guilty along with Elizabeth Device and Anne Whittle.
Alison was found guilty.
Isobel Roby, from Windle, also stood trial on charges of witchcraft at this Assize, and she too was convicted.
A WONDERFULL DISCOVERIEThe trials in Lancaster in August 1612 are among the most famous witchcraft trials in history.

Bruce Castle Museum We are most fortunate in Tottenham to have the wonderful facilities of Bruce Castle Museum to help us with both Family History and Local History projects.
Bruce Castle opened as a Museum in 1906 and now houses the Borough of Haringey's local history collections and archives.
Anyone wishing to join this group should apply to The Membership Secretary, Tottenham Civic Society, 61 Durban Road, Tottenham, London N17 8EDWe
acknowledge the help and support provided by the Museum staff in the development of our 'Summerhill Road' website which has been invaluable.

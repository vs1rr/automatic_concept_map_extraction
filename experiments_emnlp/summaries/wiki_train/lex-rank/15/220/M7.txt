British Empire The First Empire
The origins of the empire date from the late 16th cent.
with the private commercial ventures, chartered and encouraged by the crown, of chartered companies.
An integrated imperial trade arose, involving the exchange of African slaves for West Indian molasses and sugar, English cloth and manufactured goods, and American fish and timber.
In India, from the 1740s to 1763, the British East India Company and its French counterpart were engaged in a military and commercial rivalry in which the British were ultimately victorious.

The British Empire was the biggest empire the world has ever know, and it made the United Kingdom the most powerful country in the world for over a century.
The empire began in the 17th century and lasted until the middle of the 20th century It was made of all kinds of places, from dominions, colonies, protectorates and mandates all ruled or governed by the United Kingdom.
But these empires came into conflict, and in the 17th and 18th centuries England (and then, following union between England and Scotland in 1707, Great Britain) defeated France and the Netherlands and it left Britain as the main colonial power in North America and India.
But it did not all go well.
So Britain began to turn its attention to other parts of the world: Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.

On March 6, 1836, the Alamo fell to the Mexican Army under General Santa Anna.
Many were worried about Houston’s retreat, fearing that he was afraid of Santa Anna’s strength and feeling that their men had died at the Alamo in vain.
Santa Anna’s army was defeated in an 18-minute battle, and he was captured the following day.
According to its constitution, Sam Houston was unable to succeed himself as President of the Republic of Texas, so he ran for and served in the House of Representatives from 1839-1841.
Houston was defeated the first time he ran for the office of Governor of Texas, but won the election in 1859.
He moved with family to Huntsville, Texas, and died there on July 23, 1863.

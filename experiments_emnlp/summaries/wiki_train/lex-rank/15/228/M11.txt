San Felipe de Austin History San Felipe de Austin was founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin as the unofficial capital of his colony.
It became the first urban center in the Austin colony, which stretched northward from the Gulf of Mexico as far as the Old San Antonio Road and extended from the Lavaca River in the west to the San Jacinto River in the east.
Several large cotton plantations were established in the bottomlands near the town during the 1820s, and from the outset, San Felipe de Austin became a trading center for the staple.
By May 1836, as news of the Texans' victory at the Battle of San Jacinto spread, residents began returning, and a semblance of community life was soon restored near the original townsite.
By the mid-1840s, the only other buildings in the settlement were six or seven log houses and a tavern.
The colonial capital was burned in the spring of 1836 during the Runaway Scrape as Sam Houstonâ€™s volunteer forces moved eastward to ultimate victory at San Jacinto.

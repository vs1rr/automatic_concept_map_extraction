The New KingdomA. Throughout the ages known as the Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and New Kingdom, there has been alterations to their religion, art, and architecture.
Let us begin at the beginning, with the Old Kingdom.
The Old Kingdom began in the year 2700 B.C. Thepharaohs, or kings, of this time include the third through the sixth dynasty, beginning with Djoser and ending with Pepi II.
These pyramids could not have been built through coercion or slavery, forsuch an architectural feat could only have been accomplished by a labor force of 70,000,and there is no possible way for a small group of rulers to force the people to labor day inand day out without some kind of reward in the afterlife.
When the chief of a particular village came into state power, itwas his local god that became a nationally-renowned state god.
It was believed that the pharaoh was a god himself, and that his power was to berevered and worshipped.
The decline in the quality as well as the size of pyramids were the result ofthis shift in power.
Art in the Old Kingdom was not simply for beauty, but for utility as well.
The appeal of Osiris was that he promised a more democratic afterlife; the common man could lookforward to his own life after death.
Isis, Osiris' wife, fled to the delta of the Nile and gave birthto Osiris' son, Horus, posthumously.
In addition, the Middle Kingdom was renowned for it's literary masterpieces.
This new god was known as Amun-Re, and was once again the focus of the priesthood.
With this new religion, the only supremepowers were Aton and Akhenaton himself.

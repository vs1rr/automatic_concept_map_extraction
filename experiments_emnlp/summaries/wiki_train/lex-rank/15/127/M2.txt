Some castles had a moat around them and a draw-bridge that would be let down if you wanted to get into or out of the castle.
There were holes in the walls of a castle so that the archers could shoot arrows at an enemy.
But keeping castles was very expensive and only kings, lords and other noblemen could live in castles with their families.
A castle also had a big kitchen and many private bedrooms as well as bathrooms for the people who lived there.

Concentric Castles and Crusader CastlesA concentric castle is a castle with two or more concentric curtain walls, where the outer wall is lower than the inner and can be defended from it.
The layout was rectangular where the terrain permitted (Belvoir, Beaumaris), or an irregular polygon where curtain walls of a spur castle followed the contours of a hill (Krak, Margat).
While a concentric castle has double walls and towers on all sides, the defences are not necessarily uniform in all directions.
As Beaumaris was built on flat terrain, it was necessary to build walls and towers facing in all directions, giving a very regular, almost square, floor plan to the castle.

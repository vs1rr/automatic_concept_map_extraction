I am currently trying to design a European city and Castle and draw it out, but the best I can do right now is draw a sand castle, so are there any good ones out there that you don't mind sharing?
Royal castles, as far as I know, were fortified just like any other one, but they generally were much more luxurious than something along the lines of the Welsh castle that I showed you, which was a purely military installation.

DOh yeah, cities, I want to also know what the houses looked like, and the regular streets of a big city When thinking of a medieval castle-town, I always think of Rothenburg, Germany, which has many original houses from the Medieval Period.

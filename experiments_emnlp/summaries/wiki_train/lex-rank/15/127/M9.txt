Over the millennium that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, but in the popular mind castles feature a range of elements including battlements, drawbridges and arrow slits.
This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as Anglo Saxon burhs and walled cities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East; castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lords, either for themselves or for their monarch.
The word castle was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest to denote this type of building, which was then new to England.
For example, the French château is used to describe a grand country house at the heart of an estate, regardless of the presence of fortifications, and a castle is denoted by the term chateau fort.
Early castles often exploited natural defences, and lacked features such as towers and arrow slits and relied on a central keep.
In some countries, before a castle could be built it was necessary to obtain the permission of the king through a licence to crenellate, or else the builder risked it being seized or slighted – deliberately damaged to such an extent that the castle was indefensible.
These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades and inspiration from earlier defences such as Roman forts.

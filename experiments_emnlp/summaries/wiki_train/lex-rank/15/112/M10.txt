Book of Kells The Book of Kells, of which our copy is a replica, was written more than 1,200 years ago by monks in medieval Ireland.
The book, as it has survived, has 680 pages.
In 1661 the Book of Kells was transferred from Kells to the Trinity College Library in Dublin, where it has been safeguarded ever since.

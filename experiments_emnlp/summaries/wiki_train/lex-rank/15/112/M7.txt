The Book of Kells remained in the monastery at Kells until 1541, when the Roman Catholic Church took it for protection.
But these are not the hallmarks of the book, as it is the artwork contained on the remaining leaves of calfskin pages that are its major achievement.
The detail in the Book of Kells is amazing, with no one symbol duplicated elsewhere in the book.

“Candi Borobudur,the largest Buddhist monument in the world”5 of 5 stars Reviewed August 4, 2015 Our taxi picked us up at 3.30 AM & we were going to Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world.
This was such an odd time to visit some place on a holiday, but we were told that one must reach there for a stunning sunrise.
This temple is often considered as one of the world’s wonders & sits on a hill top in the island of Java.
We were given a torch & were asked to follow the guide.
It is an extraordinary structure with an equally amazing history.
Borobudur was constructed around the same period as the Shiva Prambanan temple, which is depicted by significant Hindu structures in the temple.
It is one of the few sites where you feel lucky that you have visited, seen & photographed it.

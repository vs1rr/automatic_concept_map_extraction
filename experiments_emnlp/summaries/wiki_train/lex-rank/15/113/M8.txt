Gorgeous sunrise from the temple's top The best time for a visit is early in the morning, before the sun rises.
The rituals are for the Buddhists, but non-Buddhists can see or even join the rituals.
Besides the temple visit, there are other activities you can do in Borobudur and one of them is watching a dance performance "Sendratari Mahakarya Borobudur" (Borobudur's Great Work of Art Dance) that describes how Borobudur's construction was done more than a millennia ago.
Located at Aksobla theater inside the Borobudur complex, the performance involves more than 150 men and women.
You need not travel to Thailand or India for the ride, as you can have that at Borobudur too.

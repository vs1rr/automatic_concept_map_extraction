16 JUNE, 2014 - 12:26 DHWTYThe magnificent ancient Buddhist Temple of Borobudur(Read the article on one page)Indonesia is the country with the largest Muslim population in the world.
The Borobudur Temple Compound consists of three monuments, namely the Temple of Borobudur and two smaller temples located on the east on a straight axis to the main temple.
This temple was built as a Mahayana Buddhist temple around the8th and 9 th century A.D. by the Sailendra dynasty.
This may be due to the fact that the arrival of Islam on Java during the 13 th and 14 th centuries A.D. shifted the centre of Javan life to the eastern part of the island.
By exposing the temple to the elements, the temple began to deteriorate further.
The fact that this incredible Buddhist monument continues to be treasured and protected in a predominantly Muslim country, is testament to its significant value as a cultural and historical icon of Indonesia.

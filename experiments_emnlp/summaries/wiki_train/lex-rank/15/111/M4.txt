History of Bodiam Castle (KATE)
This fabulous castle was built by the prestigious Sir Edward Dalyngrigge of East Sussex between the years of 1385 and 1388.
The land around Bodiam Castle is very lush, green and beautiful.
It is a very romantic place to live in.
The island of the castle in the moat is called the Octagon, and excavations on it have a garderobe, for the guard there.
A central social feature is the expansive Great Hall that has been used for many large banquets.
The views from the windows would be either of lush green grass or the shimmering water of the lake moat.
I am the blacksmith, I make all the armour and weapons for the castle and knights.

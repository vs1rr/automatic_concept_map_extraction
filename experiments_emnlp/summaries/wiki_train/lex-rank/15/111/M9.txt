The first thing I do with my students from Northwestern, when we stand in front of an English landscape, is to get them to look at and describe very carefully (and in very simple terms) what they think they are seeing, before we move on to what it all might mean.
You just presented a lecture about ‘How Castles work’.
What I and others have argued in the last couple of decades is that the military view of castles is not wrong, but that it is only part of the story.
In my talk ‘How Castles Work’, I’m trying to take this debate to another level.
Our view is that we need to move beyond the military/social debate and above all see the castle in its local and regional context.
We did a topographical and geophysical survey of the area around the castle and found a landscape of work – traces of iron and/or ceramic production, the mill, millpond and mill leat, the harbour… So the castle and landscape of Bodiam that we are exploring is neither simply an ornamental garden nor simply a defence against the French; it’s a complex multi-period site whose regional context and location is crucial.
I’m currently working on a new book on castles which I hope will be out in two to three years!

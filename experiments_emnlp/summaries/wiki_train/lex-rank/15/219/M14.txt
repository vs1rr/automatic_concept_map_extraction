Community and Historical Society Discuss Eighth Episode of WGN's Manhattanâ€”September 14th
"The Second Coming"There was a great turnout for the Los Alamos Historical Society's viewing of the eighth episode of WGN's new series, Manhattan, a fictionalized look at life in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project.
Did British scientists come to Los Alamos to work on the project?
British scientists did come to Los Alamos to work on the Manhattan Project.
The scientists were in fact part of the "A-team" of scientists who had been working on the idea of implosion in Europe.
The British Mission did not arrive with a suitcase of research proving that an implosion bomb would not work.
The implosion bomb was treated as a back-up design until it was found that Thin Man would predetonate, and the physics and engineering of an implosion bomb did seem more daunting in many ways than Thin Man's.

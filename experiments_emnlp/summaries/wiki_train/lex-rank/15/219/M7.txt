The Manhattan Project The making of the Atomic Bomb during World War 2The Atomic Bomb produced by the Manhattan Project In September 1938, the world was again on the brink of war.
The authors of the two separate publications were actually one team of scientists who worked together for many years, but two members, Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch, were Jews, who had to escape from the violent persecusion of Jews in Nazi Germany, as did other prominent Jewish physicists who previously worked in Germany, including the most prominent of them all, Albert Einstein.
What was so dramatic about the new discovery, which Frisch called "Nuclear Fission", was that:When hit by neutrons, some of the Uranium atoms would break and would release both energy and additional neutrons, which could hit neighbouring Uranium atoms, and that could result in a continued "chain reaction".
But Frisch and Peierls correctly calculated that if the rare Uranium 235 isotope of Uranium will be used, then just a few kilograms of it would be enough to create a chain reaction, a bomb.
Instead, it suggested to convert some of the natural Uranium to Plutonium, which would then be separated from the Uranium, and which could also produce chain reaction.
On August 2nd, 1939, six months after the published discovery of nuclear fission in Uranium, and just before World War 2 started in Europe, three Hungarian Jewish physicists, who previously participated in nuclear physics research in German universities, and then fled from German Nazism to the USA, decided that the US president must be warned of the danger that Germany will develop an atomic bomb.
In October 1941 president Roosevelt approved an American nuclear bomb development project, to be managed by the US Army.

And then, at the end of 1941, the USA was at war.
By then, two years after the original discovery of nuclear fission in Uranium, it was clear that an atomic bomb was scientifically feasiable, and it was believed that the Allies were two years behind the Germans in the race to build atomic bombs, the war-winning super weapon.

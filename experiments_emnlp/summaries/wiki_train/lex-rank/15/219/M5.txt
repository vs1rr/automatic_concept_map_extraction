By 1941, the Germans were ahead in the race for the atomic bomb.
On May 12, 1942, President Roosevelt signed an order creating a secret project to develop the nuclear weapon.
The program that developed the atomic bomb for the United States during World War II was the largest secret project ever undertaken by the U.S. government.
Since it was frequently the case the US Army Corps of Engineers offices were named for the city in which they were based, it was renamed Manhattan Engineering District, which became known as the Manhattan Project.
The Manhattan Project produced three bombs: the first bomb was known as "Gadget" and was used as a test model.
Many scientists who had produced the atomic bombs were against its use and argued to the end that the bomb should not be used for ethical reasons.
Faced with the prospect of continued annihilation of its cities, as well as not knowing that the U.S. had no other atomic bombs ready to deploy, Japan surrendered unconditionally on August 15, 1945.

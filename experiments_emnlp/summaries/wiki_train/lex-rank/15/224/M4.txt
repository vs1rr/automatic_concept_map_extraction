California Gold Rush (1848â€“1858)The great California gold rush began on January 24, 1848, when James W. Marshall discovered a gold nugget in the American River while constructing a sawmill for John Sutter, a Sacramento agriculturalist.
In San Francisco, for example, the population grew from 1,000 in 1848 to over 20,000 by 1850.
The influx of Chinese and other foreign laborers led to ethnic tensions in California, especially as gold grew scarce.

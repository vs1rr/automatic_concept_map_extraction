Pine Church (also historically known as Mill Church, Nicholas Church, and Pine Church) is a mid-19th century church near the unincorporated community of Purgitsville in the U.S. state of West Virginia.
As many of the Mill Creek valley's earliest settlers were of German descent, Old Pine Church may also have been built as a meeting place for Schwarzenau Brethren adherents, known as "Dunkers" or "Dunkards".
By 1870, Old Pine Church was primarily used exclusively by the Brethren denomination, and in 1878, the church's congregation split into White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church congregations.
In the church's adjoining cemetery, the earliest extant gravestone dates from 1834, and several unmarked interment sites may exist from as early as 1759.
According to architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi, "Old Pine Church and cemetery is an excellent example of one of the area's early rural church complexes. "
Location[edit]Old
Pine Church and its cemetery are located along the steeply-sloped Old Pine Church Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 220/15), approximately 1.66 miles (2.67 km) south of the unincorporated community of Purgitsville.
The church and cemetery are situated on 2.3 acres (0.93 ha) atop a bluff to the west of U.S. Route 220, at an elevation of 1,129 feet (344 m).
[7]Old Pine Church is located in a rural area of southwestern Hampshire County within the Mill Creek valley.
The church is located in the Mill Creek valley.
[15]Establishment[edit]A church building may have been constructed at the site of Old Pine Church as early as around 1814, and possibly as early as 1792.
[15][17] As many of the Mill Creek valley's settlers were of German descent, the Old Pine Church structure may also have been built as a meeting place for Brethren adherents, known as "Dunkers" or "Dunkards".
[20] In Dr. Emmert F. Bittinger's historical research on the Brethren Church in Hampshire County in his Allegheny Passage (1990), it is noted that the Church of the Brethren denomination recognized Old Pine Church as belonging to the larger Beaver Run congregation, which was centered approximately 10 miles (16 km) south of Old Pine Church.
[21]By 1870, Old Pine Church was primarily used exclusively by the Brethren denomination.
[18] The Beaver Run congregation modified its district's boundaries in 1879, which may have resulted in a division of the congregation at Old Pine Church into two factions: White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church.
The pressed metal ceiling may have been added during the restoration.
In 2008, the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission embarked upon an initiative to place structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places following a series of surveys of historic properties throughout the county.
[25] Old Pine Church was one of the first eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register as a result of the county's initiative.
[15]Architecture[edit]Church exterior[edit]Constructed in 1838, Old Pine Church is a large, one-story, front gable log building.
[7][25]According to architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi, the simple form and construction of Old Pine Church is indicative of the early settlers' access to materials, and it serves as an example of the log construction techniques in religious architecture of the Hampshire County's earliest settlers.
Two pews are located on the north elevation with four pews located on the south elevation; the pulpit is situated at the east elevation.
[26]CemeteryOld Pine Church is surrounded on three sides by a cemetery containing approximately 200 interments, the oldest section of which is located to the immediate east and south of the church building.

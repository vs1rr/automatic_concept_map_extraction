Historical Info Borobudur is a Buddhist candi in Magelang, Java, consisting of six square platforms surmounted by three circular platforms, atop which are 72 small stupas surrounding a large central stupa.
The structure is decorated with 2672 bas-relief carvings and 504 Buddhist statues.
The temple's three levels represent the three realms of Buddhist cosmology: the world of desires, the world of forms, and the formless world.

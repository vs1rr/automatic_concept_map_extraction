Rumors of gold in California had existed for years before the Gold Rush.
But it wasn't until gold was discovered at Sutter's mill that the Gold Rush began.
John Sutter was a Swiss emigrant who arrived in California in 1839.
He became a Mexican citizen and received a land grant of 50,000 acres in Sacramento Valley.
He built Sutter's Fort at the site of present day Sacramento.
At Sutter's Fort he developed farming and other businesses.
Sutter's Fort became a rest station for travelers and immigrants to California.

In 1847 John Sutter hired James Marshall to build a sawmill at a site named Coloma.
At the right, below, is a picture of the Mill at Coloma.
On January 4, 1848, James Marshall picked up a piece of metal at the mill that looked like gold.
They tested it and confirmed that it was gold.
He asked Marshall and the others working at the mill to keep the gold a secret.
The discovery of gold in California became national news.

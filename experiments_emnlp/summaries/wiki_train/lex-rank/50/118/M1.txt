Brougham Castle Brougham Castle is built next to the River Eamont on the site of an old Roman fort, Brocavum.
His son, Robert, who inherited the castle in 1283, was a leading figure in Edward Iâ€™s campaigns against Scotland.
He made extensive changes to the castle, improving both its defensive properties and standard of accommodation.
He added a new gatehouse complex, with an inner and outer gatehouse separated by a small courtyard, new domestic buildings suitable to house and serve the garrison he needed for his battles in Scotland, a new stone curtain wall to replace the timber palisade and in one corner he built the Tower of League which provided accommodation for important visitors.
He also increased the height of the keep by one floor to provide new private chambers which included a small oratory.
The last member of the Clifford family to live at the castle was Lady Anne Clifford who restored most of the Clifford properties and spent several months staying at each in turn.
She died at Brougham in 1676 and the Clifford castles became the property of the Earl of Thanet.

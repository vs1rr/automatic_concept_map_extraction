Bodiam Castle, with its impressive towers and broad moat, is often likened to a giant sandcastle.
Built during a time when the Nobility sought more comfortable and secure living spaces, it is more accurately described as a Courtyard Castle.
The castle's builder, Sir Edward Dalyngrigge, acquired the Manor of Bodiam in 1378 and began construction on the site.
The castle remained in the Dalyngrigge family until 1483 when it passed to the Lewknors.
Throughout its history, Bodiam Castle faced threats of invasion and piracy, leading to its fortification and eventual sale to the National Trust in 1916.
The castle has since undergone restoration and is open to visitors year-round.
With excellent car parking facilities and wheelchair access to the grounds, Bodiam Castle is a popular destination for families and history enthusiasts alike.
Lord Curzon, who fell in love with the castle in 1905, played a significant role in its preservation and restoration.
Today, visitors can explore the castle's grounds, enjoy picnics, and learn about its rich history through guidebooks and gifts available in the on-site shop.
Despite some interior limitations, Bodiam Castle's exterior beauty and historical significance make it a must-visit destination in Britain.

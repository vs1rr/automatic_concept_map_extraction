Bodiam Castle, located in East Sussex, England, was built in 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge as a fortress to defend the southern coast of England.
The castle was constructed quickly in one phase and became the Dalyngrigge family's home.
After passing through several generations, the castle was eventually sold to Nathaniel Powell in 1644 due to financial difficulties faced by the Tufton family.
The castle fell into disrepair and changed hands multiple times until it was purchased by John 'Mad Jack' Fuller in 1829, who began restoration work.
Bodiam Castle was later sold to George Cubitt in 1849 and eventually acquired by Lord Curzon in 1916.
Lord Curzon initiated a systematic restoration of the castle, which was continued by the National Trust after he gifted the castle to the nation in 1925.
The restoration included draining the moat, removing vegetation, and adding roofs to the towers and gatehouse.
Bodiam Castle is now a Scheduled Monument and a Grade I listed building, open to the public and maintained by the National Trust.
The castle features a wide moat, sweeping battlements, spiral staircases, and a gatehouse with an original wooden portcullis.
The castle's design includes various chambers built around the outer defensive walls, with water supplied to the moat by several springs.
The current entrance to the castle is via a long bridge, but the original approach involved two bridges and a drawbridge.
Bodiam Castle also has murder holes in the roof of the gatehouse and is rumored to be haunted by various ghosts.
Visitors may explore the castle's narrow and steep staircases, imagining the challenges faced by inhabitants in medieval times.
The castle's history includes sieges, changes in ownership, and restoration efforts, making it a popular tourist attraction and a filming location for movies like Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
Bodiam Castle's unique architecture and picturesque setting make it a prime example of a medieval fortress in England.

The British Empire was the largest empire in history, with colonies established for trade and financial benefit.
It began in the 15th and 16th centuries with exploration and expanded to North America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia.
By the 19th century, the Empire covered over 14 million square miles and 450 million people, with Britain as the global power.
The Empire's decline started in the early 20th century due to loss of military supremacy and financial strain after World War II.
The legacy of the Empire is debated, with some seeing it as beneficial for spreading democracy and others criticizing it for exploitation.
The Empire included countries like Australia, India, Canada, and many others, with control sometimes changing hands with other European powers.
The decline of the Empire led to the rise of the United States and Russia as superpowers.
The British Empire's impact on the world is complex and continues to be studied and debated.
The Union Flag, also known as the Union Jack, symbolizes the British Empire and dates back to 1801.

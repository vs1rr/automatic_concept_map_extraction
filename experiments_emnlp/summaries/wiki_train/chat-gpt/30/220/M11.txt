The British Empire was the largest empire in human history, lasting nearly half a millennia and reaching its height in the early 20th century.
The empire covered 13,012,000 square miles and governed 458 million people, a fifth of the world's population.
The empire began with latecomer England's commitment to trans-oceanic exploration and trade in the 15th century, leading to the establishment of the East India Company in 1600.
English navigators like John Hopkins and Francis Drake sought to break the Iberian monopoly on trans-Atlantic trade, leading to conflicts with the Spanish Navy.
The 17th century saw the colonization process begin in earnest, with the establishment of colonies in North America and the Caribbean.
The 18th century saw Britain triumph over European rivals and achieve naval supremacy, leading to increased urbanization and emigration to British colonies.
The 19th century saw the Royal Navy become a global leader in maritime technology, with a focus on trade and the abolition of slavery.
The 20th century saw the empire's decline, with economic challenges and decolonization efforts leading to the dismantling of the empire.
The legacy of the British Empire includes the spread of the English language, parliamentary system of government, and common law, as well as significant demographic changes through migration.

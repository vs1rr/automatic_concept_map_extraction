The Frischâ€“Peierls memorandum, written in March 1940, was the first technical explanation of a practical atomic weapon.
It contained calculations about the critical mass needed for an atomic bomb, accelerating British and U.S. bomb development efforts during World War II.
The memorandum, given to Marcus Oliphant and passed on to Henry Tizard, led to the formation of the secret MAUD Committee.
Frisch and Peierls calculated that an atomic bomb would require about 1 kilogram of uranium-235, challenging previous assumptions.
The memorandum influenced the development of the Tube Alloys project, the Manhattan Project, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

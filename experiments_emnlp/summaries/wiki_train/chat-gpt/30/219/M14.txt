The Los Alamos Historical Society recently hosted a viewing of the eighth episode of WGN's Manhattan, a series that fictionalizes life in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project.
The event had a great turnout, with community members and friends gathering to watch and discuss the show.
The episode focused on the British scientists who came to Los Alamos to work on the project, known as the "British Mission."
The British team, led by Professor James Chadwick, played a crucial role in the success of the Manhattan Project.
The episode also explored the reasons why the Thin Man bomb, a gun-type plutonium bomb, was not built due to experimental discoveries about plutonium isotopes.
Additionally, the episode touched on the horrors of World War II, particularly the events in the city of Minsk, which was bombed and taken over by the Germans, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Jews.
The discussion also included references to Schr√∂dinger's cat and a poem by William Butler Yeats.
Overall, the event provided valuable insights into the historical context and scientific challenges faced during the Manhattan Project, as well as the impact of World War II on different parts of the world.

Mark Oliphant was a physicist born in Australia in 1901.
Despite his father's wishes for him to become a priest, Oliphant was always more interested in science and gadgets.
He attended the University of Adelaide, where he switched his major to physics after being encouraged by a teacher.
Oliphant eventually went on to work at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, where he was part of the team that split the first atom in 1932.
He made significant contributions to nuclear research, including discovering helium 3 and tritium, as well as the concept of fusion.
During World War II, Oliphant played a key role in the development of radar technology that helped in the fight against German U-boats and bombers.


In 1940, Oliphant was involved in the early discussions about the possibility of creating an atomic bomb using uranium-235.
He traveled to the United States to advocate for the development of such a weapon, which eventually led to the establishment of the Manhattan Project.
However, after witnessing the devastating effects of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Oliphant became a vocal critic of nuclear weapons.
He joined the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs to advocate for the peaceful use of atomic energy and to prevent the further use of nuclear weapons.


Despite his contributions to nuclear research during the war, Oliphant was often excluded from scientific experiments involving nuclear power due to his anti-nuclear weapons stance.
He returned to Australia in 1950 and became the first director of the Research School of Physical Sciences at the Australian National University.
He also helped establish the Australian Academy of Science and served as its first president.
In 1959, Oliphant was knighted for his contributions to science.


After retiring from the Australian National University in 1967, Oliphant served as the state governor of South Australia from 1971 to 1976.
During his time in office, he opposed France's nuclear testing in the Pacific and advocated for voluntary euthanasia for debilitating and incurable diseases.
Oliphant passed away in 2000 at the age of 98.


Mark Oliphant will be remembered as a scientist who played a significant role in the development of nuclear technology but later became a staunch advocate for peace and the abolition of nuclear weapons.
His legacy lives on through various locations and buildings named in his honor, as well as the annual science competition named after him in South Australia.

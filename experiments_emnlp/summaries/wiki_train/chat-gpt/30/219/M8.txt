Rudolf Ernst Peierls was born in Berlin, Germany in 1907 to Heinrich Peierls and Elizabeth Weigert.
He showed an early interest in science and engineering, but his father pushed him towards studying physics.
Peierls studied at various universities in Germany, working with influential physicists such as Arnold Sommerfeld and Werner Heisenberg.
He earned his doctorate in 1929 and married Eugenia Nilolaevna Kannegisser in 1931.
Peierls worked in Rome and England before accepting a professorship at Birmingham University in 1937.
As World War II began, he sought British citizenship and became involved in the development of the atomic bomb.
Peierls worked on the Manhattan Project in the United States and continued his research in Birmingham and Oxford after the war.
He received numerous honors for his contributions to physics and published several books on theoretical physics.
Peierls' work was highly influential in the field, and he is remembered as one of the most influential German mathematical physicists who settled in Britain during the Nazi era.
His books, "Surprises in Theoretical Physics" and "More Surprises in Theoretical Physics," are recommended for physics students and teachers.
Peierls' autobiography, "Bird of Passage," provides insight into his life and work.

Photographer Martin Miller captured haunting images of the remnants of the Manhattan Project, the mission to build the first atomic bomb, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington.
The project was initiated after Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt of Nazi Germany's similar efforts.
The Manhattan Project resulted in the development of 'The Gadget', the atomic bomb detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The project's achievements were impressive, but the consequences unleashed into the world were regrettable.
The first atomic bomb was detonated in New Mexico in 1945, leading to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, prompting Japan's surrender.
The sites where the bombs were developed were massive and complex, involving advanced processes and expert engineering.
The Clinton Engineering Works in Tennessee concentrated U235 from U238, while the Hanford Engineering Works in Washington created plutonium on a large scale.
The land at these sites cannot be fully restored to its former state.
The uranium and plutonium gathered were used in bomb assembly in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
The Manhattan Project's legacy continues to haunt civilization, as the threat of nuclear weapons remains.
The sites where the bombs were developed stand as a reminder of the monumental achievements and the devastating consequences of the Manhattan Project.

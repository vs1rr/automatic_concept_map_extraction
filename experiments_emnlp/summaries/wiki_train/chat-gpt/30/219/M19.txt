The Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II.
Led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the US Army Corps of Engineers from 1942 to 1946.
The project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys, and grew to employ over 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion.
The majority of the cost was for building factories and producing fissionable materials, with less than 10% for the development and production of the weapons.


Two types of atomic bombs were developed during the war: a gun-type fission weapon using uranium-235 and an implosion-type nuclear weapon using plutonium.
Uranium enrichment methods included electromagnetic, gaseous, and thermal processes, with most work performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
Plutonium was produced through irradiation of uranium in reactors at Oak Ridge and Hanford, Washington.
The gun-type design was found impractical for plutonium, leading to the development of the implosion-type weapon at Los Alamos, New Mexico.


The timeline of the Manhattan Project begins in 1939 with Albert Einstein signing a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt advising research into nuclear fission as a weapon.
The project officially started in 1942, with key events including the establishment of the Manhattan Engineering District, the selection of sites for research and production facilities, and the first nuclear reactor going critical at the University of Chicago.
In 1945, the first nuclear explosion occurred at the Trinity test site in New Mexico, followed by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.


After the war, the Manhattan Project was officially turned over to the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1947, marking the end of the project.
The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 was signed into law by President Truman, regulating atomic research in the postwar United States.
The Manhattan District was abolished in August 1947, concluding the timeline of the Manhattan Project.

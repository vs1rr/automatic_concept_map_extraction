The Manhattan Project was a U.S. government research project that took place from 1942 to 1945 and resulted in the creation of the first atomic bombs.
The project was initiated by American scientists, many of whom were refugees from fascist regimes in Europe, who recognized the military potential of the fission process.
The project was first organized in 1939, with Albert Einstein presenting the idea to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.
The project received funding and was put under the direction of the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1941.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was tasked with constructing the necessary facilities for the project, which was managed by Brig.
Gen. Leslie R. Groves.


The Manhattan Project involved multiple lines of research and development, including the separation of uranium-235 from uranium-238, which was achieved through physical methods such as the electromagnetic and diffusion processes.
Plutonium-239 was produced through transmutation in a reactor pile at the University of Chicago.
The project also involved the design and construction of the actual atomic bombs, which were tested in July 1945 at Alamogordo air base in New Mexico.


The successful test led to the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945, effectively ending World War II.
The explosive power of the bombs was equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.
The Manhattan Project, which initially received $6,000 in funding, ultimately cost $2 billion and involved the collaboration of scientists from the United States, Great Britain, and Canada.
The project marked a significant milestone in the development of nuclear weapons and had far-reaching consequences for global security and the future of warfare.

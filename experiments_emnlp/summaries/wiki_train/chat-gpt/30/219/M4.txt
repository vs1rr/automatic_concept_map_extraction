In 1939, Albert Einstein wrote a letter to President Roosevelt warning about the potential of atomic bombs and urging the US to start research in this area.
Roosevelt initially hesitated due to funding concerns but eventually approved uranium research in October 1939.
This decision led to the establishment of the Manhattan Project, the successful atomic bomb effort during World War II.
The British, who made early theoretical contributions, deferred to American leadership due to resource constraints.
The Germans, despite fears, were not close to developing atomic weapons.
The Russians and Japanese also had research programs but did not achieve success until after the war.
Ultimately, the Americans, with their late entry into the war and resources, were able to develop and use atomic bombs, gaining a temporary monopoly on this technology.
The Manhattan Project's success was a result of Roosevelt's decisive action and the collaboration of scientists from various countries.

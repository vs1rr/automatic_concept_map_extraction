In 1923, a legend known as "The Mistletoe Bride" gained attention in America, telling the story of a bride who was lost on her wedding day and found fifty years later.
The legend is believed to have originated at Bramshill House in Hampshire, the seat of the ancient Cope family.
When American society girl Edna Hilton married Captain Denzil Cope, heir of the Cope family, she inherited the chest in which the bride was locked up and lost.
Rumors of haunting and encounters with spectres at Bramshill House began to circulate, with reports of moans, footsteps, and other eerie sounds.
The legend of "The Mistletoe Bride" has been immortalized in a song by Thomas Haynes Bayly and has been the subject of poems and ballads for centuries.
The tragic tale of the bride's slow and agonizing death in the chest on her wedding day continues to captivate the popular imagination.
The chest was exhibited to visitors at Bramshill Park for many years, and when Edna Hilton and her husband later moved to Lovell Castle in Oxfordshire, the haunting manifestations seemed to follow them.

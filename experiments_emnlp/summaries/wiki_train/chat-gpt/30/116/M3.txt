City & Country, a heritage developer, has acquired Bramshill, a significant Jacobean Prodigy House in Britain.
The Grade I Listed mansion, built in the 17th Century, features state rooms, banquet halls, a library, and two chapels.
The property also includes a stone frontispiece by John Thorpe and a lake with a geometric island.
Flanked by walled gardens and a deer park, Bramshill has a rich history dating back to the Domesday Book.
The mansion was used by the Home Office for training before being acquired by City & Country.
The company plans to restore the property to its former glory.
Bramshill is located in a desirable commuter location with easy access to London and major airports.
City & Country has a track record of restoring historic sites and creating new homes.
The acquisition of Bramshill adds to their portfolio of successful heritage projects.

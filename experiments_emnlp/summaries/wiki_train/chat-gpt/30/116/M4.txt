The Bramshill, a prestigious Police College in Britain, is known for being haunted by multiple spirits, including the White Lady, the Grey Lady, the Green Man, and others.
The White Lady, believed to be a young bride who got entombed in a mistletoe-bough chest, is known for announcing her presence with a strong floral fragrance.
The mansion has a long history of tragedy and is said to be haunted by 14 spirits.
The Grey Lady wanders in search of her husband, while the Green Man is seen near the lake.
Other ghosts, including a man in tennis gear and a child's hand placed in visitors' hands, are also reported.
The College Secretariat keeps a 'ghost file' to record encounters with these spirits.
Despite the eerie stories, most of the ghosts are considered friendly and not harmful to those who encounter them.
The Bramshill is known as the 'most haunted house in Hampshire', and visitors are encouraged to share their ghostly experiences to be added to the file.

Bramshill House and Gardens, dating back to the early 17th Century, was built by Edward, 11th Baron Zouche of Harringworth.
It is a large Jacobean 'Prodigy' house with unique eccentricities, located on a South West facing escarpment overlooking the River Hart valley.
The house has undergone various renovations and additions over the years, with the Cope family occupying it from 1703 to 1935.
The estate, now listed Grade I, sits on 106ha of grounds within a Grade II* listed park with historic landscape features dating back to medieval times.
The house was used as a maternity home during World War II and later as a home for the exiled King of Romania.

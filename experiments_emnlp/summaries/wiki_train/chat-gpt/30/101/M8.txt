The collapse of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, led to a thorough investigation by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to determine the causes and implications of the disaster.
Despite challenges such as the destruction of evidence, the team of investigators gathered data from various sources to reconstruct the events leading up to the collapse.
Through computer simulations and lab tests, they discovered that the buildings could have withstood the impact and fires if not for the dislodging of fireproofing insulation and the failure of sprinklers.
The investigation also revealed that World Trade Center Building 7 collapsed due to uncontrolled fires caused by debris from the Twin Towers.
In response to these findings, NIST issued 31 recommendations to improve the safety of high-rises and emergency responses in the face of major threats.
While some critics questioned the cost and benefits of these changes, many of the recommendations have been adopted into building codes, including requirements for additional exit stairwells, glow-in-the-dark markings in stairwells, and more effective fire-resistive materials.
These changes have been implemented in New York City and other projects in the United States, such as One World Trade Center.
Despite some disagreements over the investigation's conclusions, NIST defended its process as open and inclusive, with opportunities for public and engineering community input.
The revisions to building codes based on the investigation's recommendations have had a significant impact on building safety and emergency preparedness, with broad implications for the construction industry.

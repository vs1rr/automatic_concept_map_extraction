Medieval warfare during the Middle Ages was much more complex than the popular notion of longbowmen and knights charging across open fields.
Siegecraft was a common aspect of warfare, with castle sieges dominating major campaigns.
Besieging a castle involved careful planning, negotiation, and the use of various siege engines such as mangonels, ballistas, battering rams, and trebuchets.
The process of besieging a castle was highly choreographed and involved a combination of tactics to force surrender, including mining, blockades, and starvation.
The use of siege towers and cannons also played a role in the evolution of siege warfare.
Despite the eventual obsolescence of castles and siege engines, the conventions of siege warfare established during the Middle Ages continue to influence military strategy to this day.

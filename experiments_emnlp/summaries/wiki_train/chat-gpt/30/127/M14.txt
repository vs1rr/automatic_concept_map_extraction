Concentric castles are fortified structures with two or more curtain walls, where the outer wall is lower than the inner wall and can be defended from it.
These castles resemble one enclosure castle nested inside another, without a central keep.
The design of concentric castles was rectangular or irregular, depending on the terrain.
The concept of concentric castles may have originated in the Crusader states as a response to advances in siege technology.
The outer wall protected the inner wall from siege engines, while the inner wall and towers provided flanking fire.
Concentric castles were expensive to build and were mainly constructed by powerful military orders or kings.
The layout suited the requirements of military orders, resembling a monastery and housing a large garrison.
Concentric castles appeared in Europe in the 13th century, with examples in Wales built by Edward I. The concept of concentric castles influenced fortified cities and later fortifications.
The best-preserved example of a concentric castle is Krak des Chevaliers in Syria.

Tower houses were a type of castle built during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries in Europe.
They served as homes for kings, lords, and barons, providing domestic accommodations, storage for supplies, and defensive capabilities.
As feudal obligations became obsolete and warfare shifted to pitched battles, tower houses became symbols of status and power for the gentry and knights.
They were built for defense against neighbors and enemies, with simple architecture featuring rectangular shapes, three to four stories, and basic moldings.
Tower houses were common in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Italy, and Central Europe, with variations in design and purpose.
In Scotland, tower houses were larger and more elaborate, with additional comforts such as fireplaces and latrines.
In Ireland, tower houses were primarily the homes of wealthy landowners, providing protection, administration, and social centers for rural communities.
Tower houses in France were more fortified due to frequent hostilities, displaying impressive defenses.
Some surviving examples of tower houses include Longthorpe Tower in England, Hallbar in Scotland, and the ducal tower at Siedlecin in Poland.
These tower houses are a testament to medieval life, combining political, social, and artistic history in one structure.

Pembroke Castle has a long history dating back to 1093 when Arnulf de Montgomery built the small inner bailey.
The castle withstood a siege by the Welsh and was later reconstructed in stone by William Marshall in the late 12th/early 13th centuries.
The castle features a unique keep with a cylindrical tower and stone dome, as well as a gatehouse with complex defenses.
Notably, Henry VII was born at Pembroke Castle in 1457.
Today, the castle is owned by a Private Charitable Trust and efforts have been made to bring its history to life through exhibitions and tableaux.
Visitors can explore the castle, shop at a gift shop, and enjoy a cafe and Brass Rubbing Centre.
The castle is open all year, with additional amenities available

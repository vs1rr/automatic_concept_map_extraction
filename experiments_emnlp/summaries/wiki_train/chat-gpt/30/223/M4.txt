Constantinople, also known as Byzantium, New Rome, and Istanbul, was the capital city of the Eastern Roman Empire after the fall of Rome.
Founded by Constantine in the early 4th century, the city was strategically located on a promontory between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, with natural defenses on three sides and a defensive wall on the land access.
The city was surrounded by water, except for the side facing Europe, where walls were built.
The city had a valuable harbor in the bay called the Golden Horn.
The Theodosian walls, completed in the 5th century, protected the city and defined its limits.
Constantinople was also known for its forums, including those built by Constantine, Arcadius, Theodosius, Marcia, and Leo.

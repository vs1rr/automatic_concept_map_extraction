was hidden from the congregation by the screen.

The most famous example of this type of church is the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, built by the Emperor Justinian I.
The church was demolished in the 15th century, but its architectural plan influenced many later churches in the Byzantine world.

The Byzantine Empire left a lasting impact on the architecture of the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as on the development of Islamic and Gothic architecture.
Its influence can still be seen in the churches and buildings of Eastern Europe and the Middle East today.

The Byzantine Empire was the Greek-speaking continuation of the Roman Empire, lasting from 324 to 1453.
Initially part of the Roman Empire, it survived the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and thrived for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks.
The empire was a powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe, with its citizens continuing to refer to it as the Roman Empire.
The borders of the empire evolved over time, going through cycles of decline and recovery.
Under rulers like Justinian I and Maurice, the empire reached its greatest extent, but faced major territorial losses during the Muslim conquests of the 7th century.
The Macedonian dynasty saw a two-century long renaissance, but the empire struggled to recover during the 12th century and was eventually dissolved and divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms after the Fourth Crusade.
Despite a brief re-establishment in 1261, Byzantium remained one of several small rival states in the area until its annexation by the Ottomans in the 15th century and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.
The name "Byzantium" originated from a Greek citizen named Byzas who founded the city of Byzantium after consulting an oracle.
The term "Byzantine Empire" was coined in the 16th century by a German historian to distinguish ancient Roman from Medieval Greek history.
The early history of the Byzantine Empire saw the empire split and reunite multiple times, with Constantine the Great establishing Constantinople as the new capital in 330.
Justinian I was a great ruler who expanded the empire and built monuments like the Hagia Sophia, but his successors faced financial difficulties and struggled to maintain the empire's territory.
The empire faced threats from Persians, Slavs, and Muslims, with the Crusades further straining relations between Byzantium and the West.
The Fourth Crusade led to the conquest and looting of Constantinople in 1204, but the Byzantines eventually regained control in 1261.
The decline of the Byzantine Empire continued under the Palaeologus Emperors, with the economy crippled and the empire becoming a vassal state to the Ottoman Turks.
The final blow came in 1453 when Constantinople fell to the Ottomans, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire.

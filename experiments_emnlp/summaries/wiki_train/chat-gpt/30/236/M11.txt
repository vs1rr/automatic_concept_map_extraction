Brazil, the largest country in South America, was initially colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century.
The Portuguese developed Brazil as a plantations colony, with sugar cane being the most important crop.
Slaves were brought from Africa to work on the plantations.
In the 18th century, gold was discovered, leading to the exploration and colonization of the interior.
Brazil gained independence from Portugal in 1822, becoming the Empire of Brazil with Pedro I as emperor.
The empire was ruled as a constitutional parliamentary monarchy until 1889 when a military coup established the Republic of Brazil.
Borders were established through treaties and negotiations with neighboring countries.
Brazil was involved in several wars related to nation-building in neighboring countries.
The economy has traditionally been centered around agriculture, but has diversified in the 20th century.
Brazil is one of the BRIC countries, with a rapidly developing economy.
The population is predominantly white, followed by mulatto and indigenous peoples.
The postal history of Brazil includes the issuance of stamps since 1843, with the first stamps being the Bull's Eye design.
Airline issues also played a role in the postal history of Brazil, with airlines such as ETA, Condor, and VARIG issuing stamps for postal services.
Zeppelin mail was also a special chapter in Brazilian postal history, with special flights organized and stamps issued for use on these flights.

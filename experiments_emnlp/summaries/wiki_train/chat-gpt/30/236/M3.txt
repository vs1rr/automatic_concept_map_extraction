The Empire of Brazil was established in 1822 after a series of conflicts and movements led to the country's independence from Portugal.
Dom Pedro I was acclaimed as the emperor and ruled during the First Reign, which was marked by political instability, economic crises, and conflicts with Portugal.
The Regency Period followed, during which representatives governed in the name of Dom Pedro II until he reached adulthood.
The Second Reign, under Dom Pedro II, saw a decrease in conflicts and the consolidation of power by the rural landowners.
The economy relied heavily on coffee production, which was fueled by slave labor until the abolition of slavery in 1888.
The rubber cycle also played a significant role in the economy during this time.
The monarchy eventually fell due to a combination of factors, including dissatisfaction with the laws restricting slavery, economic crises, and political centralization.
The end of the empire was also influenced by international factors, such as the trend towards republicanism in other countries.

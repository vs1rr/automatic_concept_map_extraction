Bruce Castle Museum, Archives, and Park in Tottenham is a Grade 1 listed building with a rich history dating back to the 16th century.
Originally owned by Sir William Compton, the building was later modified by various owners, including Rowland Hill, inventor of the penny post.
The park, saved from development by philanthropist Joshua Pedley, opened to the public in 1892 and remains a popular spot for residents.
The museum houses collections on the history of the London Borough of Haringey and offers educational programs, family activities, and local history talks.
The park, Haringey's oldest, features the Great Oak tree

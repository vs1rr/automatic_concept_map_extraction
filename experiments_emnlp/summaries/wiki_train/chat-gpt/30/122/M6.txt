Bruce Castle Museum in Tottenham is a valuable resource for Family History and Local History projects.
The museum houses archives for the Borough of Haringey, including maps, census returns, newspapers, and historical photographs.
It also hosts exhibitions and workshops for visiting groups.
The museum is located in a grade 1 listed 16th Century manor house with a rich history, including being owned by the Coleraine family.
The museum is supported by two local groups, the Friends of Bruce Castle and the Haringey Local History Forum.
The Local History Forum has been disbanded, with some functions absorbed by the Tottenham Civic Society.
The society aims to educate the public about the history and architecture of Tottenham and preserve features of historic or public interest.
The museum staff has been instrumental in the development of the 'Summerhill Road' website, providing valuable information

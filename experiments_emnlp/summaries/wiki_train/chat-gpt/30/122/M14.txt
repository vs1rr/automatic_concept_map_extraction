Bruce Castle is a 16th century manor house in Tottenham with a rich history.
Originally known as 'Lordship House', the site has been owned by various families throughout the centuries.
The Round Tower, built in the 16th century, is believed to have been used for falconry.
The house was visited by Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I, and later owned by the Hare family.
Henry Hare's wife, Constantia Lucy, is said to haunt the house after her tragic death.
The house underwent renovations by Henry Hare and later by James Townsend, who added Georgian features.
The Hill family turned the house into a private boarding school for boys, which was visited by Charles Dickens and Charles Babbage.
The school closed in 1891, and the building was sold to Tottenham Urban District Council.
The grounds became a public park and the building was turned into Tottenham's first public museum in 1906.
During World War II, the museum was used as a clinic and for war exhibitions.
Today, Bruce Castle is a Grade 1 listed building and houses the London Borough of Haringey's archive and local history museum.
The building has a rich history of ownership, renovations, and uses, from being a manor house to a boarding school to a public museum.

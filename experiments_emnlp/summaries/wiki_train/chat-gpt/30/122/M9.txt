He was married twice, first to Warburga Brereton and then to Elizabeth Stonor.

He died in 1528 from the sweating sickness.
After his death, George Throckmorton sought to take over Compton's positions.
Compton's son Peter inherited Wooburn Manor, and his grandson Henry started Castle Ashley.
Sir William Compton's life was filled with scandal, power struggles, and loyalty to the King.

Bruce Castle Museum is a 16th-century manor house located in 20 acres of parkland in Haringey, London.
Operated by the Haringey Council, the museum offers exhibits on social history, local landscape, and works by local artists.
The castle has a rich history, originally owned by the Bruce family and later passed through various owners, including the 3rd Earl of Dorset and Hugh Hare, 1st Baron Coleraine.
The house was eventually renamed Bruce Castle by Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine, in honor of the Bruces of Scotland.
The museum also features displays on the history of the Post Office, the life of Rowland Hill, and the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.
The museum is free to enter and is easily accessible by public transportation.
The castle was also used as a school by Sir Rowland Hill, a social and educational reformer known for postal reform.
The school closed in 1891, and the estate was purchased by Tottenham Council, opening as a museum in 1906.
Today, the museum covers the entire London Borough of Haringey and showcases the social history and artwork of the area.
The museum is a popular tourist attraction and offers a unique glimpse into the history of Tottenham and its surrounding areas.

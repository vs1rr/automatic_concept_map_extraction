Ancient Egypt, spanning the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, has had a profound influence on Western traditions in art, architecture, and religion.
The Old Kingdom, beginning in 2700 B.C., saw the construction of the Step Pyramid by Pharaoh Zoser, marking a shift towards pyramid construction for pharaoh burials.
Religion played a significant role in Egyptian society, with beliefs in creation, gods, and the afterlife shaping their worldview.
The decline of the Old Kingdom was attributed to shifts in power and the depletion of resources due to pyramid construction and maintenance.


The Middle Kingdom, from 2050 B.C. to 1800 B.C., saw a resurgence in pyramid construction and a shift towards the worship of Osiris, a god associated with a democratic afterlife.
The myth of Osiris, involving his murder by his brother Seth and resurrection by his wife Isis, bears similarities to Christian beliefs.
Art flourished during the Middle Kingdom, with intricate jewelry and literary masterpieces reflecting the period's cultural achievements.


The New Kingdom, lasting from 1465 B.C. to 1165 B.C., saw the construction of the Valley of the Kings as burial grounds for pharaohs.
A shift in religion occurred with the rise of the god Amun-Re, and later the monotheistic worship of Aton under Pharaoh Akhenaton.
Akhenaton's reign also marked the beginning of naturalistic art in Egypt.
Internal struggles eventually led to the weakening of Egypt, culminating in conquest by the Greeks.


Despite its eventual decline, the legacy of ancient Egypt lives on in Western culture, influencing art, architecture, and religion.
The longevity and stability of ancient Egypt, lasting two and a half millennia, make it a remarkable and notable society that continues to shape our beliefs and traditions today.

Ancient Egypt has a rich history that dates back over 6,000 years to the beginning of settled life along the banks of the Nile River.
The unification of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt in the third millennium B.C. marked the beginning of the Pharaonic Age, with power centralized in the hands of a god-king.
The ancient Egyptians were pioneers in various fields, including belief in life after death, stone architecture, writing, sailing, astronomy, medicine, and art.
The Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and Second Intermediate Period saw periods of strong central government and cultural development, as well as times of civil war and foreign occupation.
The New Kingdom reached the peak of its power and territory under pharaohs like Thutmose III, but eventually declined due to internal and external pressures.
The Late Period saw Egypt under Persian rule, with intermittent periods of independence and revolts.
Despite these challenges, Egypt maintained a centralized state and a vibrant culture throughout its history.

Ancient Egypt was a civilization located in Northern Africa, centered around the Nile River.
The Nile River, the longest river in the world, provided fertile soil for farming in the "Black land" while harsh deserts surrounded the area.
The natural boundaries of Egypt, including deserts, seas, and cataracts on the Nile, helped protect the civilization from invasion for over 3000 years.


Ancient Egyptians were polytheistic, worshipping many gods, with special importance placed on sun and land gods due to their reliance on the sun and river lands.
The story of Osiris, who was murdered by his brother Seth and resurrected by his wife Isis, was symbolic for resurrection and new life.
The mummification process was used to preserve the dead for their future rebirth and resurrection.


Pyramids were built during the Old Kingdom as part of large building complexes dedicated to the dead.
These complexes included pyramids for the pharaoh, smaller pyramids for his family, and mastabas for officials.
The pyramids were stocked with supplies for the pharaoh's resurrection, including food, furniture, and jewels.


The timeline of major periods in Ancient Egypt includes the Unification of Egypt under King Narmer, the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, and the Late period.
The Old Kingdom was an age of prosperity and splendor, with pharaohs possessing absolute power and a well-organized bureaucracy.
The Middle Kingdom was considered a "golden age" due to stability and expanded trade, while the New Kingdom saw Egypt become the most powerful state in Southwest Asia.


Egyptian society had a simple structure, organized like a pyramid with the pharaoh at the top and slaves and servants at the bottom.
Marriage was arranged for young individuals, with wives respected and in charge of the household.
Women could own property and inherit, but most careers in the bureaucracy were closed to them.


The Egyptians invented hieroglyphics, a complex system of writing using pictures and abstract forms.
They also made advances in mathematics, including a 365-day calendar, and developed technologies in agriculture, literature, and more.
Egyptian art, including sculptures, jewelry, and ceramics, had a distinctive style that was easily recognizable.


Overall, Ancient Egypt was a civilization with a rich history, advanced technologies, and a complex social structure.
The civilization prospered for over 3000 years, leaving behind a legacy of art, architecture, and cultural achievements.

The Ramesside Period was a time of prosperity and stability in ancient Egypt, with a succession of kings from one family benefiting the people.
There was a push to redefine the country under the Amen cult, leading to the destruction of statues from the Amarna Period.
The reformation called for a return to traditional faith.
Kings, such as Rameses II, extended royal tombs and made them more elaborate, showing respect for traditional customs.
The tombs, both for the royal family and queens, were designed with multiple chambers, paintings, and religious texts to aid in the afterlife journey.
Family was highly valued during this period, with evidence of close kinship between rulers and elaborate tombs built for sons.

The field of art conservation is experiencing a shift towards a more scientific approach, neglecting historical knowledge and technical skill.
Many undergraduate programs in art conservation focus heavily on chemistry and materials science, with little emphasis on art history or studio art.
This trend is concerning, as students are being led to believe they are qualified to make key decisions regarding the treatment of delicate and irreplaceable objects with minimal training in art history and studio art.
Graduate programs in art conservation also lack advanced studio training, focusing more on technical training and treatment methods.
The lack of emphasis on art historical knowledge and studio skills raises questions about the qualifications of future art conservators.
It is essential for conservation students to have a solid foundation in art history in order to work professionally in the field.
The training of an art conservator depends on independent experience within the field, with internships playing a crucial role in gaining technical expertise.
The field of art conservation is described as a three-legged stool, with each leg representing different areas of knowledge required for a solid foundation.
As the field enters a "CSI" phase, it is important for conservators, art historians, artists, and the general public to trust their eyes and not rely solely on scientific knowledge when preserving artistic heritage.

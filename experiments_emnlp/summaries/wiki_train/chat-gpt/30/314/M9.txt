The CSI Effect refers to the influence of crime television shows on jurors, leading them to demand more forensic evidence in criminal trials.
This phenomenon has raised the burden of proof for prosecutors and has led to unrealistic expectations for the capabilities of forensic science.
Jurors now often request expensive and unnecessary tests based on what they have seen on TV shows like CSI.
This poses challenges for both prosecution and defense in legal proceedings.
The increased demand for forensic evidence has also inflated workloads for crime laboratories.
However, successful prosecution or defense can still occur with other important evidence such as expert testimony, crime scene reports, and medical records.
It is important to remember that no single piece of evidence should solely determine the guilt or innocence of an alleged offender.
Overall, the impact of the CSI Effect on the legal system highlights the need for a balanced approach to evaluating evidence in criminal cases.

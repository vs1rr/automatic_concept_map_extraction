Brougham Castle, located in a picturesque setting beside the River Eamont, dates back to the early 13th century and was built on the site of a Roman fort.
Initially constructed by Robert de Vipont, the castle was later expanded and fortified by the Clifford family.
The castle was sacked by Scots in 1388 and partially destroyed by a fire in 1521.
Lady Anne Clifford, a notable inhabitant, spent her later years restoring the castle and other family properties.
Visitors can explore the castle towers for impressive views and see a fragment of a Roman tombstone with an inscription.
The best views of Brougham Castle are from across the River Eamont, and nearby is the Countess Pillar, built by Lady Anne.
The partially restored Brougham Hall is also nearby.
Brougham Castle is located 1.5 miles southeast of Penrith in Cumbria, England, with limited parking available.

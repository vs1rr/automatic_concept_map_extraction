Brougham Castle, originally a Roman fort, was later taken over by the Norman family of Vieuxpont who built a stone keep and service buildings surrounded by a timber pallisade.
The current castle was founded by Hugh de Morville in the 12th century and later passed through various owners.
Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estate in the 17th century and spent years restoring the castle before making it her home.
After her death, the castle fell into ruin as stone was taken for other projects.
Brougham Castle is now an English Heritage site, open seasonally for visitors to explore.
The castle overlooks the River Eamont and is considered one of the most impressive castles in Cumbria.

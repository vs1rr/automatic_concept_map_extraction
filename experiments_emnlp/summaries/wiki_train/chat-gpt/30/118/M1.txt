Brougham Castle, located next to the River Eamont on the site of an old Roman fort, was built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vipont.
Over the years, the castle underwent various improvements and additions by different owners, including Roger Clifford and his grandson, Roger.
The castle was captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388, and eventually fell into ruin after being sold by the Earl of Thanet.
The last member of the Clifford family to live at the castle was
Lady Anne Clifford, who restored many of the family properties.

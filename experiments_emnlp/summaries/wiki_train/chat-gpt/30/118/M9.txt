Lady Anne Clifford was a determined woman who fought for 40 years to regain her inheritance and spent the rest of her life restoring the Clifford castles and churches.
She was the last of a long line of Lancastrians and had a significant impact on the Penrith area.
Lady Anne restored castles at Brough, Pendragon, and Skipton, as well as several churches.
Upon her death in 1676, Brougham Castle passed to her grandson, who dismantled it, leading to its ruin until it was rescued by the Ministry of Works in 1928.
Lady Anne also erected the Countess Pillar to commemorate her mother's death and provided money for the poor of the parish.
Today, visitors can relax in the Coronation Garden and learn about Penrith's past, including the remarkable life of Lady Anne Clifford.

Juan Erasmo Segu√≠n, Dr. James B. Miller, and Stephen F. Austin were chosen to present the petitions, with Austin ultimately going alone to Mexico.
The convention adjourned on April 13.
The event was documented in various historical sources, including writings by Stephen F. Austin, Eugene C. Barker

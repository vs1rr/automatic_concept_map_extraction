San Felipe de Austin, located near present-day Houston, was founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin and served as the unofficial capital of his colony.
It became the first urban center in the Austin colony and played a significant role in the events leading up to the Texas Revolution.
The town was a hub of activity, with a diverse population and a thriving economy based on agriculture and trade.
San Felipe hosted important conventions and meetings that laid the groundwork for Texas' independence from Mexico.
However, in 1836, the town was burned by Santa Anna's invading army during the Texas Revolution.
After the war, San Felipe was rebuilt, but it never fully regained its former prominence.
Over the years, the town's population fluctuated, and it eventually declined as residents moved to nearby communities.
Today, San Felipe is a historic site, with a state park dedicated to preserving its legacy and honoring the role it played in Texas history.

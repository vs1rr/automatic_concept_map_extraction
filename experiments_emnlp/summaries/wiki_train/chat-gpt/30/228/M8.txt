The Texian Consultations at San Felipe in 1832 and 1833 were meetings organized by the colonists in Texas to address their grievances and concerns with the Mexican government.
The first consultation in 1832 focused on issues such as the repeal of the decree forbidding North American immigration into Texas, reduced tariffs on essential goods, and the establishment of a State government for Texas independent from Coahuila.
The second consultation in 1833 further emphasized the desire for independent statehood for Texas within the Federal Mexican union, as well as tariff relief and the protection of the rights of the Native American tribes in the region.
Despite efforts to present these petitions to the Mexican government, little constructive response was received, leading to further calls for action and preparation for potential conflict with Mexico.

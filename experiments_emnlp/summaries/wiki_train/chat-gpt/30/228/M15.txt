The presentation discusses the tension between Mexico and Texas from 1823-1833.
When the Federalists were in power in Mexico City, Texas colonists were able to live undisturbed, creating their own schools, newspapers, and bringing in slaves.
However, when the Centralists took power in 1829, they ended the Texans' independent decision-making.
The first clash between colonists and Mexican authorities occurred in East Texas in 1826 when Haden Edwards settled 800 families in Nacogdoches.
The Republic of Fredonia was established by Benjamin Edwards, who believed in declaring independence from Mexico.
The Fredonian Revolt collapsed in 1827, leading to most rebels fleeing to the United States.


The Mexican government, concerned about American influence in Texas, sent General Mier y Teran to investigate.
He observed that Anglos outnumbered Mexican settlers in East Texas and recommended immediate action to prevent Texas from being lost forever.
The Law of April 6, 1830, stopped immigration from the U.S., encouraged Mexican and European immigration, and imposed customs duties on foreign goods.


The conflict escalated at Anahuac in May 1832 when settlers clashed with Mexican soldiers over enforcement of laws.
The Turtle Bayou Resolutions denied rebellion against Mexican authority and expressed support for Santa Anna.
The Battle of Velasco in June 1832 saw Mexican soldiers surrender to Texan settlers.
The Convention of 1832 and 1833 aimed to address issues such as Texas becoming a separate Mexican state and improved protection from Native Americans.

San Felipe de Austin was founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin as the unofficial capital of his colony, becoming the first urban center in the Austin colony.
The town quickly grew, attracting immigrants and serving as a hub for trade and communication.
Many significant figures in early Texas history resided in or visited the town.
San Felipe played a crucial role in the events of the Texas Revolution, hosting important conventions and serving as the capital of the provisional government.
However, in 1836, the town was burned to the ground by its own residents to prevent it from falling into the hands of the advancing Mexican army during the Runaway Scrape.
After the Texans' victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, residents began to return, but the town never fully recovered its former stature.
In 1846, the county seat was moved to Bellville, and administrative functions were removed from San Felipe in 1848.
The town was eventually incorporated in 1837 and became the county seat of Austin County.
By the mid-1840s, only a few log houses and a tavern remained in the settlement.
In 1940, most of the original townsite property was donated to the state.
San Felipe de Austin's history is marked by its role as a significant center in early Texas history, its involvement in the Texas Revolution, and its eventual decline as a commercial and administrative hub.

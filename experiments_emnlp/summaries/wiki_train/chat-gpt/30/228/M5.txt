In the early 19th century, Mexico's migration policy for Texas was similar to that for California and New Mexico.
A US citizen from Arkansas, Moses Austin, acquired land in Texas in 1820, which was confirmed by Mexico in 1823.
His son, Stephen F. Austin, began selling plots of land to settlers, attracting people from various states with the promise of affordable land suitable for farming.
However, Mexico imposed restrictions on land ownership by foreigners, leading to tensions with the Anglo settlers in Texas.


President Andrew Jackson's offer to buy Texas was rejected by Mexico in 1828.
The Anglo-American migrants in Texas proved to be industrious and educated, setting up schools and demonstrating their ability to succeed as farmers.
Mexico's elite had no interest in moving to Texas, while the poor saw limited opportunities for success.
Concerned about immigrants taking over Texas, Mexico considered settling convicts or inviting Catholic migrants from Europe.


In 1829, President Guerrero abolished slavery in Mexico's territories to discourage further migration of Anglos to Texas.
Mexico passed laws restricting foreign settlement and began actively encouraging Mexicans and Europeans to settle in Texas, leading to tensions with the Anglo settlers who wanted to preserve their culture and political rights, including the demand for slavery.


Political turmoil in Mexico saw President Bustamante facing opposition from liberals, including Santa Anna, who led an uprising against him in 1832.
Santa Anna's victory in the elections led to reforms that angered conservatives, leading to further unrest.
The Anglos in Texas called for reforms and autonomy within Mexico, but Santa Anna's dictatorship and crackdown on dissent escalated tensions.


In 1835, fighting broke out between Anglo settlers and Mexican forces, culminating in the Battle of the Alamo in 1836.
Despite a valiant defense, the Anglos were defeated by Santa Anna's army, with only a few survivors.
Santa Anna's subsequent actions, including the execution of Anglo prisoners, further fueled the conflict.
The Anglos declared independence from Mexico in March 1836, leading to the decisive Battle of San Jacinto in April, where Sam Houston's forces defeated Santa Anna's army.


Santa Anna, captured during the battle, agreed to end the fighting and withdraw Mexican forces from Texas.
The United States officially recognized Texas as independent in 1837, while Mexico refused to acknowledge its independence.
Texas gained recognition from other countries, including France, Great Britain, Holland, and Belgium, establishing trade agreements.


In conclusion, the conflict between Mexico and the Anglo settlers in Texas, fueled by issues of land ownership, slavery, and political autonomy, culminated in Texas declaring independence and gaining recognition from other nations.
Santa Anna's defeat at the Battle of San Jacinto marked the end of the Texas Revolution and the beginning of Texas as an independent republic.

The State of Coahuila y Tejas, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, had a constitutional tradition that began under the Mexican Constitution of 1824.
Influenced by the United States and Spanish constitutions, the new state of Coahuila y
Tejas was formed, with each state developing its own constitution.
The state legislature published a constitution in 1827, which included elements from the Spanish tradition, such as Catholicism as the state religion and the community property system.
The constitution also included provisions for homestead protection against bankruptcy.
The legislature also passed Decree Number 70 in 1829, exempting Anglo colonists' lands from creditor claims.
Despite the constitution's efforts to address important needs, discontent with misgovernment in Texas and political unrest in Mexico led to a new convention in 1833 that drafted a constitution for Texas as an independent state.
When Stephen F. Austin delivered this constitution to Mexico City, he was imprisoned, marking a turning point in tensions between Texas and the Mexican government.
The Constitution of 1827 was soon challenged, leading to further developments in the constitutional history of Texas.
The constitution also included provisions for promoting education, although a statewide school system was never established.
The document combined elements of the Spanish and Anglo constitutional traditions while addressing the needs of the time.

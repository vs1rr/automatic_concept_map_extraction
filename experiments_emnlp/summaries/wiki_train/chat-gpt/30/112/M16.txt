The text discusses the theory that seventh- and eighth-century illuminators of manuscripts like the Book of Kells may have used stereoscopic imagery to create intricate, microscopically detailed designs.
The author suggests that these artists may have used their eyes as a camera lucida to copy designs and then as a stereocomparator to detect and minimize disparities between repetitions.
This technique, known as free-fusion stereocomparison, could have allowed them to achieve the magnification needed to work in microscopic detail.
The text argues that this theory could explain how these artists were able to create such detailed illuminations centuries before the invention of magnifying lenses.
The author also points out that the specific quality of illumination in manuscripts associated with a particular family of monasteries supports this theory, while other Insular manuscripts do not show the same signs of using this technique.

The California Gold Rush began in 1848 when gold was discovered in the American River by James W. Marshall.
This discovery led to a massive influx of immigrants, known as "'49ers," to California, causing the population to skyrocket.
California became the 31st state in 1850, just two years after being acquired from Mexico.
The gold rush also attracted fortune-seekers from around the world, including China, Germany, Chile, Mexico, Ireland, Turkey, and France.
The Chinese adopted unique practices to protect their gold from bandits.
Ethnic tensions arose in California, leading to the Foreign Miners Tax and eventually the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882.
Despite the tensions, the Gold Rush made California one of the most ethnically diverse states in the Union by the mid-19th century.
The construction of the Panama Railway helped speed up travel to California, reducing the need for long sea voyages or treacherous overland journeys.
The Gold Rush forever changed the demographic makeup of California and had lasting effects on immigration policies in the United States.

The Pendle witches were a group of twelve people accused of witchcraft in the 17th century, with only one being found not guilty.
The trials were well-documented in an official publication by Thomas Potts, making it a well-known legend.
The accused came from two rival families, the Demdike and Chattox families, who had been known as witches for years.
The spate of witchcraft in Pendle at the time reflected the fascination and fear of witchcraft in society, influenced by King James I's views on the matter.
The trials were held in Lancashire, a region with a history of opposition to the church and sympathy towards Catholicism.
The accusations stemmed from a feud between the families, with accusations of witchcraft being used as revenge.
The trials were based on questionable evidence, including the testimony of a nine-year-old girl, Jennet Device.
Some of the accused confessed to witchcraft, while others fought to clear their names.
The trials ended with several executions and one death in custody.
The Pendle witch trials were a result of exceptional circumstances, fueled by competition, fear, and unrest in society, making it one of the most notorious witch trials in history.

A statue of Alice Nutter, one of the Pendle witches accused of murder by witchcraft in 1612, will be placed in Roughlee to commemorate the 400th anniversary of her death.
The statue, to be located on Blacko Bar Road, is yet to be designed and artists are invited to submit proposals.
The sculpture must celebrate a resident unfairly treated and represent the year 1612.
Alice Nutter, who was wealthier and less vocal than the other accused women, was executed at Lancaster Castle for allegedly bewitching a man to death.
The statue is expected to be completed

The Pendle Witch Trials, part of the Lancashire Witch Trials in England from 1612-1634, were among the most famous in English history.
The trials were well-documented by Thomas Potts in "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster."
The accused lived in the wild and lawless region around Pendle Hill in Lancashire.
The trials began with a claim by a peddler against Alizon Device for witchcraft, leading to the accusation of twelve people, including members of the Device and Chattox families.
Ten were found guilty and executed, while one was acquitted.
The trials were known collectively as the Lancashire Witch Trials.
In 1633-1634, another group of twenty, including Margaret Johnson, were tried, with most found guilty.
Johnson confessed but was later found innocent after further investigation in London.
The trials inspired the play "The Late Lancashire Witches" and Pendle Hill remains associated with witchcraft, hosting Halloween gatherings.
The trials have become a part of Pendle's tourism and heritage industries.
The accused, including Jennet Device, believed in their own guilt and practiced magic as village healers.
The trials were influenced by King James' "Daemonologie," allowing for unconventional evidence like Jennet's testimony against her family.

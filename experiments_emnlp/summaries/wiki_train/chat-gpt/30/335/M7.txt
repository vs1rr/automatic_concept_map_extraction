Joe Hesketh, an artist, delves into the horrors of the Pendle Witch Trials through his artwork.
Growing up in Pendle, he felt like he was living in a Harry Potter film set and played at being different, much like the witches.
Intrigued by the story, he embarked on a Pendle Investigation to celebrate the 400th anniversary by creating art based on the known facts.
Hesketh aims to show the true story of injustice and the misjudgment of the accused, who were mostly poor women trying to survive.
He walked the Purgatory Trail to better understand the witches' experience, feeling their presence at times.
The impact of the Trials is still felt in Pendle today, with some avoiding the topic and discrimination against those with different beliefs.
Hesketh's work aims to educate and bring a contemporary perspective to the story, resonating with his own experiences as a woman from Pendle.
Through his art, he hopes to connect people with the history of the Pendle Witches and shed light on the injustices they faced.

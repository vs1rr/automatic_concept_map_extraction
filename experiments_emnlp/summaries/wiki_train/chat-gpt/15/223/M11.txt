During the Dark Ages in the Balkans from 500AD to 1000AD, warfare was dominated by the increasing importance of cavalry and the use of bows, even in the region's wooded and mountainous terrain.
The Byzantine Empire sought to resist new barbarian invasions from the north, but by the end of the period, invaders like the Bulgars, Slavs, and Avars had established themselves in the Balkans.
The Slavs infiltrated the region in small groups, eventually settling in fortified earthworks called grads.
They were led by chieftains and developed a small cavalry force called Druzhinas.
The Bulgars, related to the Huns, had heavy noble cavalry and light horse archers in their armies.
The Avars, heavy bow-armed cavalry, allied with the Slavs, Gepids, and Bulgars to ravage the Balkans.
The Byzantine Empire, under Justinian, fought successful wars against various enemies, while the Bulgars established an independent kingdom and engaged in wars with Byzantium.
The Magyars, mounted archers, settled in Hungary and invaded surrounding territories until their defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.
The Serbs and Croats also emerged as distinct states in the region, with the Croats converting to Christianity and establishing a kingdom.
The Dark Ages in the Balkans were marked by invasions, conflicts, and the establishment of various states, with the Byzantine Empire remaining a dominant influence in the region.

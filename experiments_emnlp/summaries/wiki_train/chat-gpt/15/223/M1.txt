The Byzantine Empire, originating in 330 A.D. when Constantine
I dedicated a new Rome in Byzantium, survived for 1,000 years after the fall of the western Roman Empire.
The empire fell in 1453 after an Ottoman army stormed Constantinople.
The empire was known for its art, literature, and learning, as well as its role as a military buffer between Europe and Asia.
The empire's longevity was due to its geographic location, strong administrative center, and internal political stability.
The empire was ruled by Roman law and political institutions, with Latin as the official language, but Greek was widely spoken.
Under Justinian I, the empire reached its peak, but subsequent rulers faced financial struggles and external threats, including attacks by Islamic forces.
The empire also experienced internal conflicts, such as the Iconoclasm movement, which denied the holiness of religious images.
The empire enjoyed a golden age under the Macedonian dynasty, promoting arts, culture, and monasticism.
The empire's decline continued with the Crusades, leading to the conquest and looting of Constantinople in 1204.
The empire finally fell in 1453 to the Ottoman Empire.
Despite its fall, Byzantine culture continued to influence Western intellectual tradition and countries practicing Orthodox religion.

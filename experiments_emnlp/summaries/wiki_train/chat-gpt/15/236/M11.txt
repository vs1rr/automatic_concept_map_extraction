Brazil, the largest country in South America, was initially colonized by the Portuguese in 1500.
The Portuguese developed Brazil as a plantations colony, with sugar cane being the most important crop.
Slaves were brought from Africa to work on the plantations.
In 1808, the royal court of Portugal moved to Rio de Janeiro, and Brazil was proclaimed a kingdom in 1815.
In 1822, Pedro declared independence for Brazil and became emperor of the Empire of Brazil.
The empire was ruled as a constitutional parliamentary monarchy until 1889 when a military coup established the Republic of Brazil.
Borders were established through treaties and negotiations with neighboring countries.
Brazil was involved in several wars, including the Triple Alliance War against Paraguay.
From 1889 to 1930, Brazil was ruled as a constitutional democracy, followed by a civilian dictatorship under Getúlio Vargas.
The state of São Paulo revolted in 1932, leading to an armed conflict.
Vargas dominated Brazilian politics until 1954, when democracy was restored.
The military seized power again in 1964, leading to a dictatorship that lasted until 1985.
Since then, Brazil has been governed by democratically elected presidents.
The economy has diversified from agriculture to include mining, manufacturing, and services.
Brazil is one of the BRIC countries, with a large and rapidly developing economy.
The population is predominantly white, followed by mulatto and indigenous Amerindian peoples.
Brazil issued its first stamps in 1843 and was the second country in the world to do so.
Airline issues, including Empreza de Transportes Aereos, Condor, and VARIG, played a role in the development of postal services.
Zeppelin mail, carried on airships, was a special chapter in postal history, with special flights organized, including the 1930 First South America Flight.

The history of Brazilian law is marked by a series of constitutional changes that have shaped the country's legal system over the years.
The 1824 Constitution, established by Emperor Pedro I, set the foundation for Brazil's legal framework for the next six decades.
This constitution, influenced by both French and American models, established a constitutional monarchy with a unique fourth branch called the "moderating power" to coordinate the traditional branches of government.
Pedro I used this power to centralize authority and concentrate power in his hands.
His successor, Pedro II, continued this trend during the Segundo Reinado, focusing on issues such as slavery and the economy.


The 1891 Constitution marked the transition from an empire to a republic, drawing inspiration from the United States' Constitution.
It established a federalist system, a presidential government, and a separation of powers similar to the American model.
The new constitution aimed to promote democracy and ensure individual rights, but faced challenges due to limited popular support and political instability.


The 1934 Constitution, influenced by Germany's Weimar Constitution, introduced social and economic provisions aimed at improving the lives of citizens.
It granted voting rights to women and established labor and electoral courts.
However, the constitution's principles were not fully implemented, leading to its short lifespan.


The 1937 Constitution, enacted during Vargas' authoritarian regime, concentrated power in the hands of the President and restricted individual rights.
It aligned with fascist political models in Europe and marked a departure from previous liberal constitutions in Brazil.


The 1946 Constitution, promulgated after World War II, restored basic individual rights and established a democratic regime.
However, the military coup of 1964 led to a series of amendments that undermined the constitution's democratic character.


The 1967 Constitution, enacted under a military government, centralized power in the hands of the President and limited the role of the legislative and judicial branches.
The constitution aimed to institutionalize the military regime and increase executive influence over other branches of government.


The 1969 Constitution, considered by many to be a new constitution, further concentrated power in the executive and restricted civil liberties.
It allowed the President to shut down Congress and suspend political rights, leading to a period of authoritarian rule.


The 1988 Constitution, known as the "Citizens' Constitution," marked a transition to democracy and provided a framework for institutional stability.
It established a presidential government and ensured direct elections for chief executives at all levels.
The constitution prioritized principles over rules and emphasized access to justice as a fundamental right.


Overall, the history of Brazilian law reflects a complex evolution from monarchy to republic, authoritarianism to democracy, and centralization to decentralization of power.
Each constitution has played a significant role in shaping Brazil's legal system and political landscape, reflecting the country's social, economic, and political challenges throughout its history.

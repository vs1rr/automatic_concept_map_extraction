The article discusses the "CSI Effect," which refers to the influence of crime-related television shows on juror expectations for forensic evidence in criminal trials.
The author, Honorable Donald E. Shelton, explores whether the "CSI Effect" is a real phenomenon by conducting a study with two other criminology professors.
They surveyed 1,027 potential jurors in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to determine their television-watching habits, expectations for scientific evidence in criminal cases, and how these expectations influenced their verdict decisions.


The study found that many jurors had high expectations for scientific evidence, with a significant percentage expecting to see DNA, fingerprint, or ballistic evidence in every criminal case.
However, the study also revealed that these high expectations did not necessarily translate into a demand for scientific evidence as a prerequisite for finding a defendant guilty.
In most scenarios presented, jurors were more likely to convict based on eyewitness testimony or circumstantial evidence, even without scientific evidence.


The study also examined the role of watching crime-related television shows, such as CSI, in shaping juror expectations.
While CSI viewers generally had higher expectations for scientific evidence, these expectations did not significantly impact their verdict decisions compared to non-viewers.
The study concluded that differences in expectations about evidence did not result in important differences in the willingness to convict, suggesting that the "CSI Effect" may not have a significant impact on jury verdicts.


The author emphasizes the importance of understanding juror expectations for forensic evidence in the criminal justice system.
He suggests that prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges should be aware of jurors' increased expectations and find effective ways to address them in court.
The article also discusses the need for law enforcement agencies to adapt to these expectations by increasing resources for forensic science equipment and reducing evidence backlogs in crime laboratories.


Overall, the study's findings indicate that while jurors may have high expectations for scientific evidence in criminal cases, these expectations do not necessarily influence their verdict decisions.
The article highlights the need for the criminal justice system to adapt to evolving juror expectations and address them effectively in court proceedings.

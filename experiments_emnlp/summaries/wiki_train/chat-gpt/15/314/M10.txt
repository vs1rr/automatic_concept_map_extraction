The field of art conservation is experiencing a shift towards a more scientific approach, neglecting historical knowledge and technical skill.
Training programs for conservators are focusing more on chemistry and materials science, with little emphasis on art history and studio art.
Some undergraduate programs offer minimal studio courses and lack a strong foundation in ethics and art historical knowledge.
Graduate programs, such as those at the University of Delaware, emphasize the importance of art history in conservation work.
However, there is a lack of advanced studio training at the graduate level, with a focus on technical training in lab-based courses.
The field of art conservation is described as a three-legged stool, with each leg representing different areas of knowledge required for a solid foundation.
It is essential for conservators to have a deep understanding of art history, chemistry, and studio art in order to properly conserve cultural and historical objects.
The lack of emphasis on studio art training is concerning, as restorers often rely on their artistic ability to emulate skilled craftsmen.
Overall, there is a need for high standards in educating future art conservation professionals, with a focus on intensive training both inside and outside the classroom.
Trusting one's eyes and abandoning the notion that scientific knowledge supersedes all other considerations is crucial for ensuring the future of artistic heritage.

The CSI Effect refers to the belief that forensic science television dramas influence jurors to expect more forensic evidence in criminal cases.
While police and prosecutors are concerned about unrealistic expectations created by these shows, empirical research has not substantiated the CSI Effect.
Some studies suggest that viewers of CSI have higher expectations for scientific evidence, but this does not necessarily impact their propensity to convict.
Instead, jurors may be more influenced by technological advances in their own lives.
The popularity of forensic science TV shows has also led to an increase in universities offering forensic science degrees

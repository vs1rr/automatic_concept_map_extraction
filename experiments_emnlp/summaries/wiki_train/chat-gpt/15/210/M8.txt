Ancient Egypt, spanning the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, had a profound influence on Western traditions in art, architecture, and religion.
The Old Kingdom, beginning with Pharaoh Zoser, saw the construction of the Step Pyramid and a focus on religion, art, and the downfall of the kingdom due to internal struggles.
The Middle Kingdom, with the myth of Osiris and a shift in religion, also saw advancements in art and architecture.
The New Kingdom, marked by the Valley of the Kings and a shift in religion towards Aton under Pharaoh Akhenaton, led to the downfall of the kingdom due to internal struggles.
Despite the eventual decline of Egypt, their legacy lives on in Western culture, influencing art, architecture, and even the basis of Christianity.

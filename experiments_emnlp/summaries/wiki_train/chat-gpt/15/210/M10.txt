Ancient Egypt has a rich history that dates back over 6,000 years to the beginning of settled life along the banks of the Nile River.
The unification of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt in the third millennium B.C. marked the beginning of the Pharaonic Age, with power centralized in the hands of a god-king.
The ancient Egyptians were pioneers in various fields, including belief in life after death, stone architecture, writing, sailing, astronomy, medicine, and art.


The Predynastic Period and the First and Second Dynasties saw the development of written language, religion, and institutions that laid the foundation for Egyptian civilization.
The Nile River played a crucial role in the productivity of the land, with its annual flood cycle influencing the belief in life after death.
The unification of the Two Lands under King Menes established the first organized society in Egypt.


The Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and Second Intermediate Period were characterized by strong central government under divine kingship.
The concept of maat, representing justice and truth, guided the rule of the pharaohs.
Pyramid building and temple construction flourished during this time, with the pharaohs being responsible for maintaining order and overseeing the economy.


The New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period marked a period of territorial expansion and military strength for Egypt.
Pharaohs like Thutmose III extended Egyptian influence into Palestine, Syria, and Mesopotamia.
The cult of the sun god Ra became prominent, leading to the monotheistic beliefs of Pharaoh Akhenaten.

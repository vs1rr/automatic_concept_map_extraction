The Texian Consultations at San Felipe in 1832 and 1833 were organized by the colonists in Texas to address their grievances and concerns to the Mexican government.
The first consultation, held in October 1832, focused on issues such as the repeal of the decree forbidding North American immigration into Texas, reduction of tariffs on essential goods, and the establishment of a State government for Texas independent from Coahuila.
The delegates presented a memorial to the Mexican government outlining their loyalty to the constitution and their desire for a repeal of the restrictive laws.
The response from the Mexican authorities was mixed, with some expressing sympathy but others criticizing the actions of the colonists.


The second consultation, held in April 1833, saw a more divided group of delegates with differing opinions on the course of action for Texas.
Some advocated for independent statehood within the Mexican Republic, while others pushed for complete separation from Mexico.
A constitution was drafted, with provisions for banning banking institutions and addressing the rights of the indigenous tribes in Texas.
The delegates also petitioned for tariff relief to encourage immigration and economic development in Texas.


Despite the efforts of delegates like Stephen F. Austin and James B. Miller to present the grievances of the colonists to the Mexican government, little progress was made in addressing their concerns.
Austin's attempts to secure statehood for Texas separate from Coahuila were unsuccessful, and he was eventually arrested and held without trial for over a year.
The failure of the consultations to achieve meaningful change led to growing tensions between the colonists and the Mexican authorities, setting the stage for the Texas Revolution and the eventual independence of Texas from Mexico.

San Felipe de Austin was founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin as the unofficial capital of his colony.
It quickly became a significant urban center in the Austin colony, with a population of about 200 by 1828.
The town served as the social, economic, and political hub of the colony, with important figures in early Texas history residing there or visiting.
San Felipe de Austin played a crucial role in the events of the Texas Revolution, hosting conventions and serving as the capital of the provisional government.
The town was burned to the ground in 1836 during the Runaway Scrape, but residents eventually returned.
However, the town never fully recovered and lost its status as the county seat in 1846.
Today, the original townsite property is owned by the state of Texas.

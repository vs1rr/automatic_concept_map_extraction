Tower houses were a type of castle built in medieval Europe during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries.
They served as homes for kings and lords, as well as defensive structures and administrative centers.
In England, tower houses replaced motte and bailey castles and were used by barons for defense along the borders of Scotland and Wales.
As feudal obligations became obsolete, tower houses became symbols of status and power for the gentry and knights.
In Scotland, tower houses were larger and more elaborate, with additional comforts such as fireplaces and latrines.
Tower houses were also popular in Italy, especially in cities like San Gimignano, where ruling families built towers as symbols of strength and prestige.
French tower houses were more fortified due to frequent hostilities.
Some surviving examples include Chevenon and Rosieres in France, and Siedlecin in Poland.
These tower houses provide insight into medieval life and combine political, social, and artistic history.

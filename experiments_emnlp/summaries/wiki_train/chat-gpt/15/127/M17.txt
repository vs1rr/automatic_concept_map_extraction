Medieval warfare during the Middle Ages was much more complex than the popular notion of knights charging across open fields.
Siegecraft played a significant role in warfare, with castle sieges being a common occurrence.
Castles were used as private fortresses that symbolized the strength and status of their lords.
The process of besieging a castle involved careful planning, assembling an army, gathering supplies, and employing various tactics to force a surrender.
Negotiation, bribery, and intimidation were often used to end a siege without bloodshed.
Siege engines such as mangonels, ballistas, and trebuchets were used to breach castle defenses.
The trebuchet, in particular, was a powerful weapon that could hurl heavy projectiles over long distances.
Other tactics, such as mining tunnels under castle walls, were also employed to weaken defenses.
The article highlights various historical sieges, including the siege of Caerlaverock Castle and the siege of Rochester Castle.
The use of cannons in the late fourteenth century marked a shift in siege warfare, eventually leading to the decline of traditional castle defenses.
Despite the evolution of warfare technology, the conventions of siege warfare established during the Middle Ages continue to influence military strategies today.

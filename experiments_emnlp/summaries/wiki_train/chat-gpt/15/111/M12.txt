Bodiam Castle, located in East Sussex, England, was built in 1385 as a fortress to defend the southern coast of England.
It was constructed by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge, who obtained a license from Richard II to build the castle.
The castle was completed quickly and became the Dalyngrigge family's home.
Over the years, it passed through various owners until it was purchased by John 'Mad Jack' Fuller in 1829.
Fuller began restoration work on the castle, which was later continued by Lord Curzon.
In 1925, the castle was given to the nation and has been maintained by the National Trust since then.
Bodiam Castle is now a Scheduled Monument and a Grade I listed building, open to the public.
The castle features a wide moat, sweeping battlements, spiral staircases, and a gatehouse with an original wooden portcullis.
The castle has no keep and is built in quadrangular with various chambers around the outer walls.
The castle is known for its romantic appearance and has been featured in films like Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
Visitors can explore the castle, including the narrow and steep staircases, murder holes in the gatehouse roof, and the various ghost stories

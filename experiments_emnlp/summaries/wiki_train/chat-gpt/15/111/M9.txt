Matthew H. Johnson, an archaeologist and professor at Northwestern University, focuses on landscape archaeology, particularly in Britain and Europe from 1200 to 1800 A.D.
He recently gave a lecture on "How Castles Work" at Loyola University in New Orleans.
Johnson believes that the true purpose of archaeology is to understand human life and change in past societies.
He emphasizes the importance of careful observation and analysis in landscape archaeology, which reveals the intricate details of the past.
Johnson challenges the traditional view of castles as solely military structures, arguing that they also served as social and political institutions.
He uses Bodiam Castle as a case study to explore the multi-faceted functions of castles beyond defense.
Johnson's research at Bodiam, in collaboration with the National Trust, aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the castle's historical and regional context.
He has published books on castles and landscape archaeology and is currently working on a new book on castles.

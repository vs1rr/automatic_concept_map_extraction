On September 11, 2001, prior to the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7, there were premature announcements of the collapse by major television networks, indicating foreknowledge of the event.
Two official accounts, Account 1 and Account 2, have been proposed to explain this foreknowledge.
Account 1 suggests that WTC 7 was damaged by debris from the collapsing WTC 1, causing fires and structural damage that led to concerns of collapse.
Account 2, the current official account, states that the impact damage was not enough to cause collapse, and the fires were the primary reason for the building coming down.
However, neither account fully explains the certainty of collapse predictions made by witnesses on the scene, some of whom had this foreknowledge hours in advance.


The collapse of WTC 7 was the first known instance of a steel-framed high-rise collapsing due to fire.
The official accounts are contradicted by the fact that some firefighters and media outlets predicted the collapse before it happened.
CNN and the BBC both announced the collapse of WTC 7 prematurely, with the BBC even providing a version of Account 1 to explain the collapse.
This premature knowledge of the collapse suggests that some individuals may have had prior knowledge of the event.


The certainty of collapse predictions made by witnesses, some of whom had this knowledge hours before the collapse, cannot be explained by the official accounts.
The evidence of foreknowledge points towards a controlled demolition of WTC 7.
The unique and fatal internal collapse sequence proposed in Account 2 was not witnessed by anyone and took place right before the collapse, making it unlikely that such predictions could have been made based on observable events.
The premature announcements by media outlets further support the idea that foreknowledge of the collapse existed.

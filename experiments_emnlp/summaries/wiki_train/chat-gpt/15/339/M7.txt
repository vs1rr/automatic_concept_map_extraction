In this text, Publius Huldah discusses the concept of nullification and rebukes those who deny its legitimacy.
Nullification is the idea that states have the right to reject or refuse to comply with unconstitutional federal laws or actions.
Huldah argues that nullification is a natural right of self-defense and is a reserved power of the states under the 10th Amendment.
She points out that nullification is necessary when the federal government oversteps its constitutional authority and violates the rights of the states and the people.
Huldah also addresses false assertions made by nullification deniers, such as the belief that the Supreme Court is the final authority on constitutionality and that James Madison opposed nullification.
She provides evidence from historical documents and writings to support her arguments and emphasizes the importance of understanding the principles of the Founding Fathers in order to uphold the Constitution and protect individual rights.

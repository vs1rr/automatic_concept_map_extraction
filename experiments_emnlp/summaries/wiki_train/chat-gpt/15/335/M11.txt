In 1612, ten people were convicted of witchcraft in Lancaster and hanged on the moors above the town.
The accused, including two men and an elderly woman, were believed to have committed crimes such as laming, causing madness, and practicing witchcraft.
The story of the Pendle Witches began in the remote Pendle Forest, where a young woman named Alison Device was accused of bewitching a peddler who refused her request for a pin.
This led to a series of arrests and trials, with family members and acquaintances also implicated in various crimes.
The trials, presided over by Sir Edward Bromley, included testimonies of familiar spirits, clay images, and a witches' Sabbath.
Despite flimsy evidence, many of the accused were found guilty and sentenced to death.
The trials were documented in a biased account by Thomas Potts, titled "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster," which highlighted the political and religious tensions of the time.
The Pendle Witch trials remain infamous for the ten lives lost due to accusations of witchcraft, a crime that no longer exists today.

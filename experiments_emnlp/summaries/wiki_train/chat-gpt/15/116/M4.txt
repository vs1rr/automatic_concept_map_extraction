The text describes the haunted history of Bramshill, a Jacobean mansion in Britain that now houses the prestigious Police College.
The mansion is said to be haunted by multiple spirits, including the White Lady, the Grey Lady, the Green Man, and others.
The White Lady, believed to be a young bride who died tragically, is known for announcing her presence with a floral fragrance.
The Grey Lady wanders the mansion in search of her husband, while the Green Man is seen near the lake.
Other ghosts, including a man in tennis gear and a child's hand that appears to visitors, haunt different areas of the mansion.
The text also mentions the College Secretariat keeping a 'ghost file' to record encounters with these spirits.
The history of Bramshill is filled with tragic tales, including the story of the mistletoe-bough chest where a bride hid and became entombed.
The mansion's grandeur and idyllic surroundings add to the eerie atmosphere of the haunted house.
Visitors are encouraged to share their ghostly experiences at Bramshill to be included in the 'ghost file'.
Despite the numerous spirits that reportedly haunt the mansion, most are described as "friendly" and not harmful to those who encounter them.

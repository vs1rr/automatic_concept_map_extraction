Brougham Castle, located near Penrith, was originally a Roman fort before being taken over by the Norman family of Vieuxpont to build a castle.
The castle later passed to Robert Clifford, who strengthened its defenses during the Scottish wars.
Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estate in 1643 and spent years restoring several castles, including Brougham.
The castle fell into ruin

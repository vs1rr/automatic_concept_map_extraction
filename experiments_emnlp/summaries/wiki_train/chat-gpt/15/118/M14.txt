Brough Castle, located in Brough, was built in 1090 on the ruins of a Roman fort.
It was constructed by William Rufus as a defense against the Scots, but was taken by the Scots in 1136 and later retaken by the English in 1157.
The castle underwent restoration and additions over the years, but was destroyed by a fire in 1521.
Lady Anne Clifford began restoration works in 1661

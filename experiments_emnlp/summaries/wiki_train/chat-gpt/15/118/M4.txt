Brougham Castle, located in a picturesque setting beside the River Eamont, dates back to the early 13th century and was built using stones from a nearby Roman fort.
The castle was extended and fortified by Robert Clifford in the 13th century to withstand attacks from the Scots.
Lady Anne Clifford, a notable inhabitant, spent her later years restoring the castle and other family properties.
Visitors can explore the castle towers for impressive views and see a fragment of a Roman tombstone with an inscription.
Nearby attractions include the Countess Pillar and the partially restored Brougham

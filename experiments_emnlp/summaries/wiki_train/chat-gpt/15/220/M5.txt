The defeat of Napoleon in 1815 marked the end of a prolonged global conflict for Britain, which had been ongoing since the 1740s.
Despite fears of renewed war, Britain emerged as a dominant imperial power among Europe's Great Powers.
The country's commercial and financial strength, along with its navy's global supremacy, helped maintain peace.
The Act of Union with Ireland in 1801 consolidated the home islands, while Britain's empire consisted of colonies in North America, South Africa, and the Caribbean.
In India, British expansion was driven by personal ambitions, commercial interests, and the need for revenue.
The growth of Britain's empire in Africa, India, and the eastern hemisphere was shaped by global warfare and encounters with different societies.
The value of the western empire to Britain remained significant, overshadowing Asian trade until the 1840s.
The expansion of the British Empire was not a result of conscious planning, but rather a product of fears, ambitions, and encounters with local societies.

The British Empire was the largest empire in human history, lasting nearly half a millennia and reaching its height in the early 20th century.
The empire covered 13,012,000 square miles and governed 458 million people, a fifth of the world's population.
The empire's origins can be traced back to the late 15th century when England began exploring trans-oceanic trade routes.
Queen Elizabeth I's reign marked the beginning of England's transition into an empire, with English navigators like John Hopkins and Francis Drake playing key roles in expanding England's maritime power.
The 17th century saw the colonization process begin in earnest, with the establishment of chartered companies exploiting resources in North America and the Caribbean.
The 18th century saw Britain triumph over its European rivals and achieve naval supremacy, leading to increased urbanization and emigration to British colonies.
The 19th century saw the Royal Navy become a global leader in maritime technology, with Britain producing goods on a massive scale for colonial and foreign markets.
The century also saw the abolition of slavery and the expansion of British control in India, Africa, and Asia.
The 20th century saw Britain's decline as a global power, with economic challenges and the dismantling of the empire following World War II.
Decolonization efforts led to the independence of many former colonies, with the British Empire officially coming to an end in 1982 with the handover of Hong Kong to China.
Despite its end, the British Empire's legacy remains in the form of language, legal systems, and demographic changes in both Britain and former colonies.

The British Empire was the largest empire in history, with colonies established for trade and financial benefit.
It began in the 15th and 16th centuries with exploration and expanded to North America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia.
By the 19th century, the Empire covered over 14 million square miles and 450 million people.
Britain's naval supremacy allowed it to control world trade and act as a global policeman.
However, the Empire began to decline in the early 20th century due to a loss of military and naval supremacy, as well as financial strain after World War II.
The legacy of the Empire is debated, with some arguing it brought democracy and structure to developing nations, while others criticize its exploitation of resources.
The decline of the Empire led to the rise of other superpowers like the United States and Russia.

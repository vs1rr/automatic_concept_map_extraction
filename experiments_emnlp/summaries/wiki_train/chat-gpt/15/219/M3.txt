In the early stages of World War II, the British Mission played a crucial role in the development of nuclear weapons.
Initially skeptical of the military applications of uranium fission, British researchers began exploring the possibility of an explosive chain reaction.
The turning point came with a memorandum by Frisch and Peierls in 1940, which outlined a method for assembling a uranium-235 weapon.
This led to the establishment of the MAUD Committee, which commissioned research at various universities and industries.
By 1941, the feasibility of a uranium bomb was established, and plans for cooperation with the United States were made.
The Quebec Agreement in 1943 formalized joint efforts on the bomb project, with British scientists joining American teams at Los Alamos and Berkeley.
Despite initial reservations and challenges, the collaboration between the British and Americans on the Manhattan Project proved to be successful.
The British contribution, though small, had a positive impact on the morale and scientific discussions at Los Alamos.
The postwar period saw the British develop an independent nuclear weapons program, thanks in part to the knowledge gained during the wartime collaboration.
The 1958 U.S.-U.K. Agreement for Mutual Cooperation on Atomic Energy further solidified the partnership in nuclear defense.
The story behind the MAUD Committee's name, inspired by a cryptic message from Niels Bohr to Frisch, adds a touch of intrigue to the history of the British Mission.
Ultimately, the collaboration between the British and Americans on nuclear weapons development proved to be a crucial turning point in the history of nuclear technology and defense.

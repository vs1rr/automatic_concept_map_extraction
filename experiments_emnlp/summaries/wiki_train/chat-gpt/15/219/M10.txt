Two physicists at the University of Birmingham, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, played a crucial role in the development of nuclear weapons.
They published a memorandum 75 years ago outlining the possibility of creating a super bomb, which was previously considered science fiction.
With the support of Birmingham professor Mark Oliphant, they had access to the necessary resources to conduct their research.
Their calculations showed that only five kilos of pure U235 would be needed to create a chain reaction and achieve temperatures as hot as the core of the Sun.
This information was sent to the government, leading to the development of the British version of the bomb before the Americans.
The story of their groundbreaking work is now being portrayed in a play called "Oppenheimer" by

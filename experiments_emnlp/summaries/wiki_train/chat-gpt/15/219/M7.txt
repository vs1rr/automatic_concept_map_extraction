The Manhattan Project was a top-secret initiative during World War II that aimed to develop the atomic bomb.
It began with the discovery of nuclear fission in Uranium, leading to the realization that an atomic bomb was scientifically feasible.
The project combined American and British efforts, with the US Army Corps of Engineers leading the way.
The main tasks included acquiring Uranium ore, developing methods for Uranium enrichment and Plutonium production, designing bomb mechanisms, and building facilities.
Over 130,000 people were employed, and several city-sized installations were built in Oak Ridge, Hanford, and Los Alamos.
Under the leadership of Leslie Groves and J. Robert Oppenheimer, the project successfully produced three atomic bombs in less than three years.
One was tested in July 1945, while the other two were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.
The project's insights highlighted the potential for mass destruction and the need for nuclear disarmament.
The delay in taking action was attributed to the dismissal of advanced science by the Nazis, who lost the chance to win the war due to their racist arrogance.
The Manhattan Project's legacy underscores the importance of preventing the use of atomic weapons in future conflicts.

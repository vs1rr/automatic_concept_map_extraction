He earned his doctorate in 1929 and married Eugenia Kannegisser in 1931.
Peierls worked in Rome and England before accepting a professorship in Birmingham in 1937.
During World War II, he played a key role in the development of the atomic bomb, working with Otto Frisch and Klaus Fuchs.
After the war, he continued his research in Birmingham and Oxford, receiving numerous honors for his contributions to physics.
Despite being falsely accused of espionage, Peierls had a successful career and published many influential papers in theoretical physics.
He also authored books on surprising results in physics and his autobiography.

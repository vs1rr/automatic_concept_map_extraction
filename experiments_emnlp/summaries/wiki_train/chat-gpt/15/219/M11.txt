Britain's nuclear weapons program began with the MAUD Committee in 1940, leading to cooperation with the U.S. during WWII.
After the war, Prime Minister Attlee established a secret committee to develop atomic energy policy.
Physicist William G. Penney played a key role in the British atomic weapons program, leading to the first British nuclear test, code-named Hurricane, in 1952.
The test was successful, and Britain was now on equal footing with the U.S. and USSR in terms of nuclear capabilities.
The test was conducted in the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Australia, and the bomb used was a plutonium implosion device similar to the Fat Man.
The test was designed to investigate the effects of a ship-smuggled bomb, and the explosion vaporized the test ship, leaving a saucer-shaped crater on the seabed.
The test marked the beginning of Britain's nuclear weapons program, which continued to develop with the construction of nuclear reactors and plutonium processing plants.
Penney's expertise in shock waves and implosion studies played a crucial role in the success of the program.
The test was a significant milestone in Britain's nuclear weapons development, putting them on par with other nuclear powers.

Otto Robert Frisch was an Austrian-British physicist known for his work on the atomic bomb.
Born in Vienna in 1904, he studied physics at the University of Vienna and later worked in Germany before moving to London in 1933 due to the rise of Adolf Hitler.
In 1938, he, along with his aunt Lise Meitner, explained the process of nuclear fission.
During World War II, he worked on the Frisch-Peierls memorandum, which outlined the process for creating an atomic explosion using Uranium-235.
Frisch later worked on the Manhattan Project in the US, where he determined the critical mass of enriched uranium needed for the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
After the war, he returned to England and continued his work in nuclear physics.
He retired in 1972 and passed away in 1979.
Frisch also co-founded a company, Laser-Scan Limited, to exploit a device he designed for measuring tracks in bubble chambers.
He published several works, including "Atomic Physics Today" and "What Little I Remember."
Frisch's contributions to nuclear physics and his role in the development of the atomic bomb have left a lasting impact on the field.

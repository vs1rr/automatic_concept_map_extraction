The Manhattan Project was a top-secret U.S. government initiative during World War II to develop the atomic bomb before Germany or Japan.
The project was spurred by a warning from Albert Einstein about the potential for nuclear weapons.
The U.S. introduced its own nuclear program in 1942, with research conducted in three secret cities.
The first atomic bombs were designed and built at Los Alamos, NM, and tested at Trinity in New Mexico.
The bombs, "Little Boy" and "Fat Man," were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan's unconditional surrender.
The project remained classified for years, and its impact on warfare and scientific discovery was profound.
The development of the atomic bomb was controversial, with some scientists opposing its use for ethical reasons.
The project's legacy is explored in various books, including "The Making of the Atomic Bomb" by Richard Rhodes and "Hiroshima" by John Hersey.
The Manhattan Project marked the beginning of the nuclear age and introduced the world to the destructive power of atomic weapons.

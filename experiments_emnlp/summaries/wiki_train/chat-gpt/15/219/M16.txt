The Manhattan Project was a top-secret American effort during WWII to build the first atomic bomb.
It was initiated after Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt about the Nazis potentially creating their own atomic bombs.
The project involved key figures such as Robert Oppenheimer, General Leslie R. Groves, and Vannevar Bush, who worked with scientists and mathematicians to develop the bomb.
Canada and Britain also contributed to the project by providing resources like uranium.
The first atomic bomb was tested in 1945 and later dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of WWII.
The Manhattan Project marked the beginning of the nuclear age and had a significant impact on global warfare.
The project also involved espionage, with Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs playing a role in the development of the bomb.

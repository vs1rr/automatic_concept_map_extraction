Old Pine Church, also known as Mill Church, Nicholas Church, and Pine Church, is a mid-19th century church located near Purgitsville, West Virginia.
It was built in 1838 as a nondenominational "union church" and may have served as a meeting place for Schwarzenau Brethren adherents.
Over the years, the church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination, with the congregation splitting into White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church in 1878.
Both congregations continued to use the church until 1907.
The church also housed a school in the early 20th century.
In 1968, the community raised funds to restore the church, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

The interior features a pressed metal ceiling and pews dating back to 1857.
The adjoining cemetery contains approximately 200 interments, with the oldest gravestone dating back to 1834.
The church and cemetery are located on a bluff in the Mill Creek valley, surrounded by old-growth forests.


The land where Old Pine Church stands was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, granted by Charles II of England in 1649.
The church was likely built around 1814, with the current structure dating back to 1838.
It served various Christian denominations, including the Brethren, and was used for community gatherings, funeral services, and annual church services.
The church's simple design and construction reflect the early settlers' access to materials and serve as an example of early rural church architecture in Hampshire County.


Today, Old Pine Church is still used for community events and burials, although regular church services have not been held there since the mid-20th century.
The church's restoration in 1968 included painting the weatherboards, installing a new roof, and repairing the original windows.
The cemetery surrounding the church contains a mix of simple and more elaborate gravestones, with some dating back to the late 18th century.


Overall, Old Pine Church is a significant historic site in Hampshire County, representing the early settlement and religious practices of the area.
Its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places highlights its importance as a rural religious landmark in the Potomac Highlands.

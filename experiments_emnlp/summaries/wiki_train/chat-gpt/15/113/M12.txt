Indonesia is home to numerous cultural and natural World Heritage Sites, including the Borobudur Temple Compounds and Komodo National Park.
The Borobudur Temple Compounds, built by the Syailendra Dynasty between 750 and 842 AD, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Central Java.
It represents a blend of indigenous ancestor worship and Buddhist concepts, with the main threat being development that could compromise its value.
The site is managed by various entities and includes community development programs to ensure sustainability.

Komodo National Park, known for its endemic Komodo Dragons, covers both land and marine areas in East Nusa Tenggara.
The park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991 to protect the endangered species and biodiversity.
However, there are challenges such as depletion of prey species and destructive fishing practices.
The park management has set up a 25-year Management Master Plan to guide sustainable development.


Both sites use various strategies for marketing and promotion, including celebrity endorsements and recognition from organizations like the New 7 Wonders of Nature and Guinness World Records.
However, there are ongoing issues related to balancing preservation and commercialization, as well as ensuring benefits from tourism are equitably distributed among local communities.
Overall, these World Heritage Sites in Indonesia face challenges but are working towards sustainable management and conservation.

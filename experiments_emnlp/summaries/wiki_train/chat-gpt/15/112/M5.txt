The Book of Kells is a famous illuminated manuscript, also known as the Book of Columba, created by Celtic monks around AD 800 in the style of Insular art.
It was named after the Abbey of Kells in Ireland, where it was kept for much of the medieval period.
The exact date and place of production of the manuscript are debated, with theories suggesting it was created at Iona and finished at Kells.
The book contains the four gospels of the Christian scriptures, written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script.
The manuscript is in remarkably good condition, with intricate full pages of artwork and a broad palette of colors.
Despite its age, the Book of Kells was never finished, with some pages only outlined.
The text is accompanied by detailed decorations and illuminated initials, with ten full-page illuminations and 13 pages of decorated text.
The manuscript is believed to have been the work of Columban monks associated with the community at Iona.
While some pages have been lost, the Book of Kells remains a remarkable example of medieval artistry and craftsmanship.

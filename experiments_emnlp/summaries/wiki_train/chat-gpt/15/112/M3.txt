The Book of Kells is a highly ornate and unique copy of the New Testament of the Bible, considered a national symbol of Irish culture.
Created by Columban monks, its exact origins are still debated, with theories suggesting it was made in Kells, Iona, or Northumberland.
The book is known for its intricate knotwork patterns, vibrant colors, and angular runic font.
Made from vellum, the pages required the skins of over 185 calves.
The inks used in the book come from a variety of sources, including minerals, shellfish, berries, and lichens.
The Book of Kells is now housed in Trinity College Library in Dublin, where it has been on display since the mid-19th century.
Its creation required precise and painstaking work, showcasing the beauty and complexity of Celtic art.

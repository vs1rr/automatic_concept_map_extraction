Bruce Castle is a 16th century manor house in Tottenham with a rich history.
Originally known as 'Lordship House', it has been owned by various families throughout the centuries.
The Round Tower, built in the 16th century, is believed to have been used for falconry.
The house was visited by Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I, and later owned by the Hare family.
Henry Hare's wife, Constantia Lucy, is said to haunt the house after her mysterious death.
The house underwent renovations by Henry Hare and later by James Townsend.
In the 19th century, the Hill family turned the house into a private boarding school for boys, which was visited by notable figures such as Charles Dickens and Charles Babbage.
The school closed in 1891, and the building became a public museum in 1906.
During World War II, the museum was used as a clinic and for war exhibitions

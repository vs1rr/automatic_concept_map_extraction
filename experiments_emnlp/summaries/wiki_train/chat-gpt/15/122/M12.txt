Bruce Castle in Tottenham is the second most famous building in the area after White Hart Lane Stadium.
Originally built in 1254 by the Bruce family, the manor house has a rich history, including hosting visits from Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.
The house was later turned into a school known for its progressive teaching methods.
Today, Bruce Castle is a museum with exhibitions on Haringey's history and Rowland Hill.
The house has undergone several renovations over the centuries to align with changing architectural styles.
The tower on the left was built to house falcons, and the house has never had a military function.
Despite its changes, Bruce Castle remains a significant historical landmark in Tottenham

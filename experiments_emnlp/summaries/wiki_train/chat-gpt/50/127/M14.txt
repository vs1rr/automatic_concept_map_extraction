Concentric castles are a type of castle with two or more concentric curtain walls, where the outer wall is lower than the inner and can be defended from it.
They resemble one enclosure castle nested inside the other, without a central free-standing keep.
The layout of concentric castles can be rectangular or irregular polygon, depending on the terrain.
The design may have originated in the Crusader states as a response to advances in siege technology.
The outer wall protected the inner one from siege engines, while the inner wall and projecting towers provided flanking fire.
Walls typically include intramural towers, arrow slits, and wall-head defenses.
The gate and posterns are strengthened with a bent entrance and flanking towers.
Concentric castles were expensive to build and were mainly constructed by powerful military orders or kings.
They coexisted with more modest enclosure castles and tower keeps.
Concentric castles appeared in Europe in the 13th century, with examples in Wales built by Edward I. The concept of mutually reinforcing lines of defense with flanking fire was continued in later fortifications.
The principle of an outer and inner wall was also used in fortified cities.
The influence of crusader fortification can be seen in some European castles.
The concentric layout suited the requirements of military orders by resembling a monastery and housing a large garrison.
Krak des Chevaliers in Syria is the best-preserved concentric crusader castle.
Beaumaris Castle in Wales, built by Edward I, is an outstanding example of a concentric castle, although it remains unfinished.
The concentric design allowed for defenses to be concentrated at vulnerable points, making them difficult to breach.

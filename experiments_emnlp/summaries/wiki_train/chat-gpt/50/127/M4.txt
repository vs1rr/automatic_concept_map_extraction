During the Middle Ages, castles were built as fortified homes for kings and nobility to defend themselves and rule over their land.
Originally made of wood, castles were later constructed with stone for added strength.
They were strategically built on hills or near natural features for defense.
Common castle features included a moat, keep, curtain wall, arrow slits, gatehouse, and battlements.
Famous castles such as Windsor Castle, Tower of London, Leeds Castle, Chateau Gaillard, Cite de Carcassonne, Spis Castle, Hohensalzburg Castle, and Malbork Castle have historical significance.
Fun facts about castles include the use of siege engines, the practice of sieges, storing ale in a room called the buttery, and keeping cats and dogs to control rats.
Castles declined in popularity after the Middle Ages due to advancements in artillery that could easily breach their walls.

Edward I's Welsh Castles played a significant role in the period from 1297 to 1413, contributing to the conquest and later governance of Wales.
These castles, built by Edward and his master mason James of St. George, served multiple purposes including socio-economic and administrative functions, military defense, and propaganda to symbolize English authority over Wales.
The castles were instrumental in establishing English control over Wales, facilitating settlement and Anglicisation, and enforcing legal reforms.
While their military effectiveness was debated, the castles played a crucial role in protecting English settlements during revolts, such as the Glyn Dwr revolt.
Additionally, the grandeur and scale of the castles served as a symbol of Edward's power and authority, attracting settlers and reinforcing English dominance in Wales.
Despite their high cost and eventual decline in maintenance, Edward's Welsh Castles were integral to his strategy of incorporating Wales into the English realm and asserting royal prerogative over the region.

Castles were initially made of wood, but during the 10th century, people began constructing them out of stone with walls up to 30 feet thick.
Some castles had moats and drawbridges for protection.
The bailey was the enclosed area around the inner part of a castle, making it difficult for enemies to attack.
Castles were strategically built on high mountains, along rivers, lakes, hilltops, and near the sea for defense.
Archers used holes in the walls to shoot arrows at enemies, and heavy iron doors made it challenging to enter.
Castles were dark and cold but provided protection from enemies, making them desirable for kings, lords, and noblemen.
Castles were important in a divided Europe, as they helped defend the land and were the center of castle life with feasts, kitchens, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
However, by 1500 A.D., castles lost their significance as enemies began using cannons and kings relied on one large army for protection.
Ultimately, castles became less safe and were no longer as essential for defense.

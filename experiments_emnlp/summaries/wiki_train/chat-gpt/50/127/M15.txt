Harewood Castle, the oldest building at Harewood, underwent a major repair and consolidation project in 2004-2005 with support from English Heritage and the Harewood Estate.
The castle was granted a 'license to crenellate' in 1366, indicating its fortification.
The structure was designed to balance security and comfort, with features like a portcullis and thick walls for defense, as well as mullioned windows and internal walkways for aesthetics and convenience.
The castle's setting on a steep slope with views of Wharfedale was meant to impress and showcase status.
After passing through generations of the de Aldeburgh family, the castle fell into disrepair and was eventually abandoned by the Ryther family in the 17th century.
The fate of the castle, whether it was left to decay or repurposed for materials, remains unknown.
The castle's history reflects a mix of practicality, luxury, and changing tastes over the centuries.

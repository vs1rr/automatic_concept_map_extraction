Castles have taken on many forms over the centuries, with features such as battlements, drawbridges, and arrow slits being commonly associated with them.
Historically, castles were private fortified residences owned by feudal lords or monarchs, serving purposes such as military defense, administration, and domestic living.
The word "castle" is derived from the Latin word "castellum," meaning "fortified place," and has been used to describe various structures, including Iron Age fortifications.
Castles were initially built from earth and timber, later replaced by stone for increased defense.
They played a significant role in medieval warfare, with many castles being established by Norman invaders in England to secure their conquests.
Over time, the design and aesthetics of castles became more important, reflecting the power and prestige of their occupants.
However, with the advancement of powerful cannons, castles lost their military significance and were eventually replaced by country houses as high-status residences.
Castles are primarily found in Europe and the Middle East, dating back to the Middle Ages.
They served as both defensive and offensive structures, controlling the surrounding areas and providing a base for raids.
Castle architecture evolved in response to changing siege technology, and they also functioned as centers of administration and symbols of power.
In some countries, permission from the monarch was required to build a castle, while in others, lords had more autonomy in castle construction.
The decline of true castles began in the 16th century with the advent of artillery forts and country houses that were more comfortable and less vulnerable to attacks.
In the 18th century, there was a revival of interest in castles, leading to the construction of mock castles as part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, although they no longer served a military purpose.

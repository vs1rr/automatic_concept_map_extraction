The Brazilian Empire was established in 1822 after declaring independence from Portugal, with Dom Pedro I and later Dom Pedro II as rulers.
Brazil was politically stable and had a powerful army, winning wars and expanding its borders.
It became a republic in 1889.
The empire had a bicameral parliament, guaranteed civil rights, and a multicultural population.
Dom Pedro
I faced conflicts, including a revolt in Cisplatina that led to the independence of Uruguay.
Dom Pedro II took over as emperor in 1841 and led Brazil to peace and stability.
Brazil defeated Argentina in the Platine War, helped Uruguay in the Uruguayan War, and joined forces with Argentina and Uruguay in the War of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay.
After abolishing slavery in 1888, Brazil saw the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, ending the monarchy.
Dom Pedro II did not support the monarchy's continuation, leading to a bloodless coup d'etat by army officers.

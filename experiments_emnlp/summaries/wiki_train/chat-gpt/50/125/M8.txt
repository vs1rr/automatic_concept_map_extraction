Old Pine Church, also known as Mill Church, Nicholas Church, and Pine Church, is a mid-19th century church located near Purgitsville, West Virginia.
It was constructed in 1838 as a nondenominational "union church" and may have served as a meeting place for Schwarzenau Brethren adherents.
Over the years, the church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination, with the congregation splitting into White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church in 1878.
Both congregations continued to use Old Pine Church until 1907.
The church also housed a school in the early 20th century and underwent a restoration in 1968.
Today, Old Pine Church is still used for community gatherings, funeral services, and an annual church service.
The church and its adjoining cemetery were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012 due to its significant settlement-era rural religious architecture.
The church is a one-story log building with a pressed metal ceiling and pews dating back to 1857.
The cemetery contains approximately 200 interments, with the oldest gravestone dating back to 1834.
Old Pine Church is a significant example of early rural church architecture in the Potomac Highlands region.

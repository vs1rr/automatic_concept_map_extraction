In 1386, the French prepared to invade England by imposing high taxes on nobles to fund the extravagant outfitting of their fleet.
The fleet was decorated with coats of arms, banners, and gilded masts, and provisioned with a variety of food supplies.
Dutch mercenaries were hired for the fighting, and the French were confident of their preparations, believing the English were already defeated.
In response, King Richard II raised an army and appointed commissioners to raise militias and man coastal garrisons.
Lookout posts and barricades were established, some made from French wine barrels filled with sand.
The English plan was to let the French march inland before destroying their supply ships and confronting them in battle.
However, bad weather dispersed the French fleet, with some ships being captured by the English.
The survivors returned to Sluys, and another invasion was not attempted due to the late season and weather conditions.
Sir Edward Dallingridge, commissioner of array for Sussex, was granted a license to fortify his manor house, leading to the construction of Bodiam Castle in 1385

Matthew Johnson, a Professor in the Department of Anthropology at Northwestern University, is interested in landscape archaeology, particularly focusing on human life and change in human societies.
He believes that the true purpose of archaeology is to understand and account for humans in the past, regardless of their social status.
Johnson enjoys carefully observing and dissecting the details of the landscape, as well as tracing the transition from medieval to early modern rural landscapes.
He recently presented a lecture on "How Castles Work" at Loyola University in New Orleans, where he discussed the multifaceted functions of castles beyond just military purposes.


In his research, Johnson has found that castles also served as stage settings for various social activities, such as hunting, feasting, and the exercise of lordship and justice.
Castles were surrounded by designed landscapes that manipulated different views of and from the castle.
Johnson argues that castles were not only military structures but also political-economic institutions that controlled flows through the landscape, including goods, animals, and humans.
He aims to move beyond the traditional military versus social debate surrounding castles and explore their broader significance in medieval society.


Johnson focuses on Bodiam Castle in England as a prime example of a castle that was built for more than just defense.
While military theorists emphasize its strategic location and defensive features, Johnson and his team have conducted research at Bodiam that suggests a more complex understanding of the castle.
They have found evidence of an elaborate designed landscape surrounding the castle, as well as traces of iron and ceramic production, a mill, and a harbor.
Johnson believes that Bodiam is a multi-period site that must be viewed in its local and regional context to fully appreciate its significance.


Johnson has written a book on castles titled "Behind the Castle Gate" and another book on landscape archaeology called "Ideas of Landscape."
He is currently working on a new book on castles that he hopes will be published in the next two to three years.
Readers interested in learning more about Johnson's research can visit his website, where links to forthcoming articles on Bodiam Castle are posted.
Johnson's work emphasizes the importance of understanding the human aspect of archaeology and the intricate relationships between castles, landscapes, and society in the medieval period.

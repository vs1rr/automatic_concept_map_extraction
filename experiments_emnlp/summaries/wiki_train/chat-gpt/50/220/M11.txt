The British Empire was the largest empire in human history, lasting nearly half a millennia and at its height covering a quarter of Earth's landmass and governing a fifth of the world's population.
The empire began with latecomer England's commitment to trans-oceanic exploration and trade in the 15th century, leading to a transition into an empire under Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century.
The 17th century saw the colonization process begin in earnest, with a focus on North America and the Caribbean.
The 18th century saw Britain triumph over European rivals and achieve naval supremacy, leading to increased urbanization and expansion in North America.
The 19th century saw the Royal Navy become a global leader in maritime technology and leadership, with a focus on trade and the abolition of slavery.
The 20th century saw the empire's decline, with decolonization efforts beginning after World War II and culminating in the dismantling of the empire.
The legacy of the British Empire includes the spread of the English language, parliamentary system of government, and common law, as well as significant demographic changes through migration.

The British Empire was the largest empire in history, with colonies established in North America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia.
At its peak from 1815 to 1914, the Empire covered over 14 million square miles and had a population of 450 million.
Britain's naval supremacy allowed it to control world trade and act as a global policeman.
The Empire was vital for trade and made Britain a wealthy nation, with the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcasing its diversity and richness.
However, the decline of the Empire began in the early 20th century due to a loss of military and naval supremacy, as well as financial strain following World War II.
The United States and Russia emerged as superpowers, leading to the Empire's eventual dissolution.
The legacy of the British Empire is complex, with some viewing it as beneficial for developing nations by introducing democracy, while others criticize its exploitation of resources.
The Empire's vast reach included countries like Australia, India, Canada, and many others, with control often changing hands and boundaries shifting over time.
The Union Flag, also known as the Union Jack, symbolized the British Empire's power and influence.

Borobudur is a Buddhist stupa and temple complex in Central Java, Indonesia dating from the 8th century, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It is the largest Buddhist structure in the world and is set in the heart of the Kedu Plain with active volcanoes in the background.
The history of Borobudur is not definitively known, but it is believed to have been built in the 8th century during the Sailendra dynasty.
The construction took 75 years and was completed in 825 AD.
The site was likely abandoned and hidden for centuries before being rediscovered by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1814.
The site was fully unearthed in 1885 and underwent restoration in the 20th century.
Borobudur was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1991.
The site was heavily affected by the eruption of Mount Merapi in 2010, but restoration efforts have been ongoing.
Visitors can explore the monument, its reliefs, and statues, and should be respectful of its religious significance.
Borobudur is a popular tourist attraction and is best visited early in the morning to avoid crowds.
Nearby attractions include Candi Mendut, Candi Pawon, and other temples in the Kedu Plain.
Visitors can stay in budget, mid-range, or luxury accommodations in the area.
Borobudur is a must-visit destination for those interested in history, culture, and religious heritage in Indonesia.

The Borobudur Temple Compound in Indonesia is a significant historical site that showcases the country's pre-Islamic era dominated by Hinduism and Buddhism.
Built in the 8th and 9th centuries by the Sailendra dynasty, Borobudur is the largest Buddhist temple in the world.
However, the temple was abandoned by the 16th century due to the shift of Javan life to the eastern part of the island with the arrival of Islam.
Over the centuries, Borobudur was forgotten and covered in volcanic ash and vegetation.
In the 19th century, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles initiated an excavation of the temple, leading to further deterioration and looting of artifacts.
In 1948, the Indonesian government and UNESCO launched the "Save Borobudur" campaign, which involved a massive restoration effort that took eight years and $25 million to complete.
The restoration included dismantling the lower terraces to clean and treat each stone, as well as cleaning and treating the relief panels.
An extensive drainage system was also installed to reduce erosion.
Despite the successful restoration, ongoing conservation efforts are necessary to protect Borobudur, as evidenced by the recent threat from the eruption of Mount Kelud.
The fact that this Buddhist monument is treasured and protected in a predominantly Muslim country highlights its cultural and historical significance as an icon of Indonesia.

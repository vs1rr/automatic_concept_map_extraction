The Borobudur Temple Compounds in central Java is a famous Buddhist temple dating back to the 8th and 9th centuries.
It consists of a pyramidal base with five terraces, a cone trunk with circular platforms, and a monumental stupa at the top.
The walls are adorned with low reliefs, and there are 72 openwork stupas around the circular platforms, each containing a Buddha statue.
The temple represents the Buddhist concept of the Universe divided into three spheres.
The site also includes two smaller temples, Mendut and Pawon, representing phases in the attainment of Nirvana.
The temple was used as a Buddhist site until the 10th to 15th centuries when it was abandoned.
It was rediscovered in the 19th century and restored in the 20th century.
The temple is considered a masterpiece of Buddhist architecture and monumental arts, influencing Indonesia's art and architecture from the 8th to 9th centuries.
The property faces threats from development, tourism, deterioration of building stone, and unsupervised visitors.
The temple has been reconstructed using original materials and is protected under Indonesian cultural heritage laws.
Management of the site includes monitoring programs, community development initiatives, and plans for risk preparedness.
The Borobudur Temple Compounds are a significant World Heritage site with outstanding universal value and a reflection of the blending of indigenous ancestor worship and Buddhist concepts.

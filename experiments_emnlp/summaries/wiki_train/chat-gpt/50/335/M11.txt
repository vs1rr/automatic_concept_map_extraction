In 1612, ten people were convicted of witchcraft at the Summer Assize in Lancaster Castle and were hanged on the moors above the town.
Among them were two men and an elderly woman.
Their crimes included laming, causing madness, and "simple" witchcraft, as well as being implicated in unexplained deaths dating back decades.
The story of the Pendle Witches began in the remote Pendle Forest in Lancashire, where the accused lived among stark hillsides and scattered hamlets.


The events leading to the trials started with a young woman named Alison Device, who, after being refused a pin by a peddler, used her familiar spirit in the form of a dog to harm him.
This led to a series of confessions and arrests, with nineteen people, including members of the Device and Whittle families, incarcerated in Lancaster Castle awaiting trial.


The trials began on August 18th, with Old Chattox, Elizabeth Device, and James Device being the first to stand trial.
Elizabeth's nine-year-old daughter Jennet provided damning evidence against her mother, leading to her conviction.
Other accused individuals included Anne Redfearne, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John and Jane Bulcock, Margaret Pearson, and Isobel Roby, all of whom were found guilty based on hearsay evidence and testimonies.


The trials also included the Samlesbury Witches, who were acquitted after claiming to be victims of a Catholic plot.
On the second day of trials, Anne Redfearne, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John and Jane Bulcock, and Margaret Pearson were convicted based on flimsy evidence and testimonies.
Alizon Device, the last of the Pendle witches to be tried, was found guilty based on the testimony of her victim, John Law.


The trials culminated in the hanging of the ten condemned prisoners on August 20th, 1612.
The events were documented in Thomas Potts' book "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster," which provided a biased but detailed account of the trials.
The trials took place during a time of political and religious tension, with anti-Catholic rhetoric playing a role in the prosecutions and convictions.


Overall, the Pendle Witch trials of 1612 remain among the most famous in history, with ten individuals losing their lives after being found guilty of witchcraft, a crime that no longer officially exists.
The trials shed light on the superstitions and beliefs of the time, as well as the influence of politics and religion on the justice system.

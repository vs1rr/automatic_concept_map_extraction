Joe Hesketh, an artist, delves into the horrors of the Pendle Witch Trials through his art.
Growing up in Pendle, he felt like he was living in a Harry Potter film set, playing at making spells and perfumes.
Intrigued by the Pendle story, he embarked on a Pendle Investigation to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the trials.
Hesketh aims to show the true story of injustice and highlight that the accused were healers, not evil magicians.
The twelve accused of witchcraft were mostly poor, single women who were simply trying to survive.
Hesketh walked the Purgatory Trail in 2011 to better understand the story, feeling the eerie presence of the witches along the way.
The impact of the trials is still felt in Pendle today, with bus routes, pubs, and local ales named after the witches.
Despite some reluctance to discuss the trials, Hesketh's work aims to educate and bring a contemporary perspective to the story.
Through his art, he hopes to connect people to the history of the Pendle Witches and shed light on the injustices they faced.

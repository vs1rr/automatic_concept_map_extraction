The Pendle Witch Trials, part of the Lancashire Witch Trials in England from 1612 to 1634, were among the most famous witch trials in English history.
The trials were well-documented by Thomas Potts in "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster."
The accused lived in the Pendle Hill area of Lancashire, a region known for witchcraft.
The trials involved accusations of witchcraft, with some of the accused confessing to selling their souls to the Devil.
Twelve people were accused, including members of the Device and Chattox families.
Ten were found guilty and executed, while one was acquitted.
The trials were part of a larger witch hunt in Lancashire, with additional trials in 1633-1634.
One of the accused, Margaret Johnson, confessed to witchcraft but was later found innocent after further investigation in London.
The trials inspired a play and continue to be associated with Pendle Hill, attracting tourists to the area.

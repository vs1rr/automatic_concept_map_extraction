The Pendle witches were a group of twelve people accused of witchcraft in the 17th century, with only one being found not guilty.
The trial was well-documented in an official publication by Thomas Potts, making it a well-known legend.
The accused came from two rival families, the Demdike and Chattox families, who had been known as witches for years.
The background of the trials included a general fear and fascination with witchcraft, fueled by King James I's interest in the topic.
The accusations against the Pendle witches stemmed from a feud between the families and incidents of alleged witchcraft, leading to the trial and eventual execution of some of the accused.
The trials were held in Lancaster in August 1612, with some of the accused genuinely believing in their guilt while others fought to clear their names.
The extent of the Pendle witch trials was exceptional, reflecting the social and political climate of the time.

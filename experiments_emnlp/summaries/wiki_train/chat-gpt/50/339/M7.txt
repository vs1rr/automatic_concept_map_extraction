In this text, Publius Huldah discusses the concept of nullification and rebukes those who deny its legitimacy.
Nullification is the idea that states have the right to nullify unconstitutional acts of the federal government.
Huldah argues that nullification is a natural right of self-defense and is a reserved power of the states under the 10th Amendment.
She points out that nullification is necessary when the federal government oversteps its constitutional bounds and violates the rights of the states and the people.
Huldah also addresses false assertions made by nullification deniers, such as the belief that the Supreme Court is the final authority on constitutionality and that states must submit to federal laws regardless of their constitutionality.
She provides examples of historical instances where nullification was used to protect states and individuals from unconstitutional federal actions.
Huldah concludes by urging readers to educate themselves on the Constitution and to reject the lies and misinformation spread by those who oppose nullification.

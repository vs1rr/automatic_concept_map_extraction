In this text, James Madison discusses the Virginia Resolutions passed in response to the Alien and Sedition Laws.
The resolutions express a commitment to defending the Constitution, maintaining the union of states, and opposing any infringement on the principles of the Constitution.
The resolutions assert that the federal government's powers are derived from the Constitution and are limited by its provisions.
They also affirm the states' right to interpose if the federal government exceeds its constitutional authority.
Madison argues that the states, as parties to the Constitution, have the ultimate authority to judge whether the government has violated the compact.
He addresses objections that the judiciary should be the sole interpreter of the Constitution and explains that the resolutions are meant to address extraordinary cases where all constitutional forms may fail to prevent dangerous violations of rights.
Madison emphasizes the importance of returning to fundamental principles to safeguard against government degeneracy and asserts that the states' role as intermediaries between the people and the federal government is crucial for maintaining liberty.
He concludes that the resolutions are a necessary reminder of the authority of constitutions over governments and the sovereignty of the people.

Bruce Castle Museum is a 16th-century manor house located in 20 acres of parkland in Haringey, London.
The castle is operated by Haringey Council as a local history museum, showcasing exhibits on social history, local landscape, and works by local artists.
The castle's history dates back to the Bruce family, who owned parts of the manor of Tottenham from the 13th century.
The oldest part of the house is a round tower of red brick built in the 15th century, with a new brick house added in the 16th century.
The house has passed through various owners, including the 3rd Earl of Dorset and Hugh Hare, 1st Baron Coleraine.
The castle is said to be haunted by the ghost of Hare's first wife, Constantia.
The castle was used as a school in the 19th century by Sir Rowland Hill, known for postal reform.
The school closed in 1891, and the estate was bought by Tottenham Council, opening as a museum in 1906.
The museum covers the history of the London Borough of Haringey, with exhibits on the Post Office, Rowland Hill, and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.
The museum also features collections of artwork depicting Tottenham through time.
Admission to the museum is free, and the closest underground stations are Wood Green or Seven Sisters followed by bus 243.

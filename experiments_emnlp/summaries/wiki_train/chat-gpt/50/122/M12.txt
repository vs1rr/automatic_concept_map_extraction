Bruce Castle in Tottenham is the second most famous building in the area after White Hart Lane Stadium.
Originally built in 1254 by the Bruce family, the manor house was later acquired by Sir William Compton in 1514 and rebuilt.
It was visited by Henry VIII and Elizabeth I in the 16th century.
The house was known as 'The Lordship' until it was renamed by Henry Hare, 2nd
Baron Coleraine in the 17th century.
The house never had a military function and a tower on the property was built to house falcons.
In the 19th century, the house became a school known for its progressive teaching methods.
It is now a museum with exhibitions on Haringey's history and Rowland Hill.
The house was extensively remodeled in the 18th century to align with Georgian architectural styles.
The view from the observation platform is said to be astonishing.
The house has undergone various changes over the centuries, with the stucco being removed in the 18th century.
A drawing from 1793 shows the house looking similar to how it does today.
Another drawing from 1815 gives a eerie, Romantic/Gothic view of the house.

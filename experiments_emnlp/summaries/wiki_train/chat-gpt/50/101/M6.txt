The final tower at the World Trade Center in New York, 2 World Trade Center, has been designed by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels.
The 80-storey building will feature a unique design of seven separate boxes stacked on top of each other, reaching a height of 1,330ft and becoming the third tallest building in Manhattan.
The tower is set to open in 2020 and aims to blend in with the surrounding urban environment, appearing as a vertical village from Tribeca and a unified structure from the World Trade Center.
The building will include outdoor gardens on the upper floors of each block.
News Corp and 21st Century Fox are among the companies that have signed tentative leases for offices in the building.

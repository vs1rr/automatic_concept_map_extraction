Building 7, a 47-story skyscraper in the World Trade Center complex, collapsed at 5:21:10 pm on September 11, 2001.
Despite not being hit by an airplane, it suffered minimal damage compared to other buildings nearby.
Some key facts about Building 7 include the fact that if fire caused its collapse, it would be the first ever fire-induced collapse of a steel-frame high-rise, and its collapse was not mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report.
It took the federal government seven years to conduct an investigation and issue a report on Building 7, and over 1,700 architects and engineers have called for a new investigation into its destruction.

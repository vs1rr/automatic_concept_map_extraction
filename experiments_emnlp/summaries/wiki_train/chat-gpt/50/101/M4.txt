7 World Trade Center is a building in Lower Manhattan, New York City, that was originally completed in 1987 and destroyed in the September 11 attacks.
The current building, developed by Larry Silverstein, opened in 2006.
The original building had difficulties attracting tenants until Salomon Brothers signed a long-term lease in 1988.
On September 11, 2001, the building was damaged by debris and fires, eventually collapsing at 5:20:33 pm.
The new building, completed in 2006, is tall and incorporates safety features such as a reinforced concrete core and wider stairways.
It is also environmentally friendly, receiving LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.
The new building's design allows for the restoration of Greenwich Street and includes green design features.
The building is bounded by Greenwich, Vesey, Washington, and Barclay streets, with a small park across Greenwich Street occupying space that was part of the original building's footprint.
The collapse of the original 7 World Trade Center made it the first tall building to collapse primarily due to uncontrolled fires and the first steel skyscraper to collapse due to fire.

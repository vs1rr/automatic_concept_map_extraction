The collapse of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, led to a thorough investigation by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to determine the causes and implications of the disaster.
Despite challenges such as the destruction of evidence, the team of investigators gathered data, conducted lab tests, and developed computer models to understand how the buildings failed.
The investigation revealed that the impacts of the aircraft dislodged fireproofing insulation, leaving the steel vulnerable to fire weakening.
Additionally, the lack of functioning sprinklers exacerbated the situation.
The collapse of World Trade Center Building 7, which was not hit by an aircraft, was attributed to uncontrolled fires causing structural weakness.
In response to these findings, NIST issued 31 recommendations to improve the safety of high-rises and emergency responses in the face of major threats.


Critics emerged against these recommendations, citing concerns about costs and a lack of consensus over the investigation results.
Some questioned the openness and peer review process of the investigation, leading to disagreements over the conclusions.
Despite these criticisms, NIST defended its investigation and stood by its findings regarding the collapses of the Twin Towers and WTC 7.
The agency made efforts to involve the public and engineering community in the review process, but some still disputed the inevitability of the collapses.


Nevertheless, NIST's recommendations have led to significant changes in building codes, with 23 changes to the 2009 editions and 17 changes to the 2012 editions of the International Codes.
These changes include requirements for extra exit stairwells or specially designed elevators in tall buildings, glow-in-the-dark markings in stairwells, and more effective fire-resistive materials.
These code changes have broad implications for building safety and have been adopted by state and local authorities, with New York City and projects like One World Trade Center already implementing them.


Overall, the forensic investigation of the Twin Towers collapse has not only provided answers to long-standing questions about the events of 9/11 but has also led to important revisions in building codes that aim to prevent future tragedies.
Despite criticism and disagreements, the changes in response to the investigation's recommendations have been significant and have improved the safety of high-rises and emergency responses in the face of major threats.

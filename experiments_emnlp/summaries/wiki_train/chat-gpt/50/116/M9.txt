Bramshill House and Gardens, dating back to the early 17th Century, was built by Edward, 11th Baron Zouche of Harringworth.
It is one of the largest Jacobean houses with a unique design and history.
The house was re-fronted in 1703 and underwent various renovations over the years.
The estate, now listed Grade I, sits on 106ha of grounds within a Grade II* listed park.
The park features historic landscape elements dating back to medieval times, including Lord Zouche's 17th Century park.
The house was used as a maternity home during World War II and later as a residence for the exiled King of Romania.
In 1953, the Home Office acquired the property for a National Police Training College, leading to the development of new buildings on the estate.
The grounds include walled gardens, terraced areas, and parkland with mature trees and a man-made lake.
The estate retains historic tree avenues and axial rides, some with trees dating back to before 1700.
Bramshill House is situated on a plateau overlooking the River Hart valley, with a picturesque setting surrounded by woodland and lawns.
The estate has a rich history and has undergone various changes and additions over the centuries, making it a significant heritage site with a blend of architectural styles and landscape features.

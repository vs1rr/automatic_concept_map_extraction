The Bramshill, a prestigious Police College in Britain, is known for being haunted by multiple spirits, including the White Lady, the Grey Lady, the Green Man, and others.
The White Lady, believed to be a young bride who got entombed in a mistletoe-bough chest, is said to announce her presence with a strong floral fragrance.
The Grey Lady wanders the mansion in search of her husband, who was beheaded in the early 17th century.
The Green Man, a member of the Cope family who drowned in a lake, is seen near the water-lake.
Other ghosts, including a man in tennis gear and a child's hand placed in visitors' hands, haunt various rooms and areas of the mansion.
Despite the numerous ghostly encounters, most of the spirits are considered friendly and not harmful.
The College Secretariat keeps a "ghost file" to record encounters with these spirits, making the Bramshill known as the "most haunted house in Hampshire."
Visitors are encouraged to share their ghostly experiences to be added to the file.

Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, was an English diplomat known for his lone vote against the condemnation of Mary, Queen of Scots, and for organizing a stag-hunt where the Archbishop of Canterbury accidentally killed a man.
He was born on June 6, 1556, and died on August 18, 1625.
Zouche was the son of George la Zouche, 10th Baron Zouche, and Margaret Welby.
He married Eleanor Zouche in 1578, but abandoned her shortly after the birth of their second daughter, Mary, in 1582.
Eleanor's father complained to Lord Burghley about Zouche's treatment of her.
After Eleanor's death in 1611, Zouche married Sarah Harrington, but they had no children.


Zouche studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was appointed a Commissioner for the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, where he was the only Commissioner to offer dissent against the judgement.
He later served as Ambassador to Scotland, Lord President of the Council of Wales, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.
Zouche was also involved in the Virginia Company and had a strong interest in horticulture, maintaining a physic garden at his house in Hackney.


In 1605, Zouche purchased the manor of Bramshill in Hampshire and built a mansion on the site.
During a visit to Bramshill, the Archbishop of Canterbury accidentally killed a gamekeeper during a stag-hunt, tarnishing his reputation.
Zouche died in 1625, and the Barony of Zouche fell into abeyance between his daughters Mary and Elizabeth.
The abeyance was resolved in 1815 in favor of Cecil Bisshopp, 12th Baron Zouche.


A document found in the house of Sir Jasper More in 1959 revealed a mystery concerning four children who traveled to America on the Mayflower in 1620.
The document, dated 1622, detailed the disposal of Samuel More's children, who were sent to the Colony of Virginia as indentured servants on the counsel of Lord Zouche.
Three of the four children died during the first winter, with only Richard More surviving.


Throughout his career, Zouche held various offices, including Ambassador to Scotland, Ambassador to Denmark, Deputy Governor of Guernsey, Lord President of the Council of Wales, and Privy Counsellor.
He was also involved in the Virginia Company, New England, and various commissions related to treasury, ecclesiastical causes, and land titles.


Overall, Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, was a prominent English diplomat known for his independent stance on important matters, his involvement in various offices and commissions, and his role in a tragic incident during a stag-hunt at Bramshill.
His legacy includes his contributions to diplomacy, horticulture, and the resolution of the Barony of Zouche.

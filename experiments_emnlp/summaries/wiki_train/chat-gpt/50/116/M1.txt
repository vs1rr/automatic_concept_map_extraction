In 1923, a New York society girl, Edna Hilton, married Captain Denzil Cope, heir of the ancient Cope family in England.
The Copes were known for owning the chest in which the Mistletoe Bride was found, a tragic legend of a bride who was lost on her wedding day and not found until fifty years later.
The legend was said to have occurred at Bramshill House in Hampshire.
After Edna inherited the chest, reports of encounters with spectres and ghostly sounds emerged from the house, leading to much gossip and speculation in New York society.
The legend of the Mistletoe Bride was a popular old English family tale, immortalized in poems and ballads, depicting the tragic fate of the bride who died a slow and agonizing death in the chest.
Lord Lovell, the bridegroom, spent his life searching for his lost bride, only to find her remains in the secret chest fifty years later.
The story of the Mistletoe Bride continues to captivate the popular imagination, with the chest being exhibited to visitors at Bramshill Park for many years.
Edna and Denzil later moved to Lovell Castle in Oxfordshire, where the spectre of the Mistletoe Bride seemed to follow them, leading to further haunting manifestations.

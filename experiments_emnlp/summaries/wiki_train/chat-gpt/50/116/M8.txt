Bramshill House is a historic mansion located in Bramshill, northeast Hampshire, England.
Originally built in the early 17th century by Baron Edward la Zouche, the house is one of the largest and most important Jacobean prodigy house mansions in England.
The architecture of the three-storey building was inspired by the Italian Renaissance and executed mainly by German builders.
The mansion features a symmetrical design with a central loggia, ornamental pierced parapets, and large gables.
The interior of the house is richly furnished with period pieces, including large tapestries depicting historical figures and scenes.
The Great Hall, drawing room, library, and staircase are particularly notable for their elaborate decorations and architectural details.


The mansion is set in 262 acres of grounds, which include an 18-acre lake and 25 acres of early 17th-century formal gardens.
The wider medieval park was landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century and contains woodland.
Bramshill House has a long history as a local sporting and social venue, with the cricket ground hosting first-class matches in the early 19th century.
During the Second World War, the mansion served as a Red Cross maternity home and later became the residence of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania.


In 1960, Bramshill House became the location of the Police Staff College and later housed the European Police College.
The property was acquired by the British government in the 1950s and underwent various renovations and additions over the years.
However, by the late 1980s, the estate had become expensive to maintain, leading to criticism of lavish spending on the property.
In 2013, the Home Office placed the house and estate on the market for Â£25 million, citing high annual operating costs.
The property was eventually sold to heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014.


Despite its historical significance and architectural beauty, Bramshill House has faced challenges in terms of maintenance and upkeep.
The mansion is known for its haunted reputation, with stories of ghosts, including a bride who locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later.
The house remains a symbol of English architecture and history, attracting visitors and historians interested in its rich past and grandeur.

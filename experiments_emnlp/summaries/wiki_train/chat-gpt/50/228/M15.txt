The presentation discusses the tension between Mexico and Texas from 1823-1833.
When the Federalists were in power in Mexico City, Texas colonists were able to live undisturbed, creating their own schools, newspapers, and bringing in slaves.
However, when the Centralists took power in 1829, they put an end to the Texans' independent decision-making.
The first clash between colonists and Mexican authorities occurred in East Texas in 1826 when Haden Edwards permitted 800 families to settle in Nacogdoches, where families were already living without titles.
This led to the Republic of Fredonia, a failed attempt at declaring independence from Mexico.
The Mier y Teran investigation revealed that Anglos outnumbered Mexican settlers in East Texas, leading to the Law of April 6, 1830, which stopped immigration from the U.S. and encouraged Mexican and European immigration to Texas.
The conflict at Anahuac in May 1832, led by John Davis Bradburn, resulted in the Turtle Bayou Resolutions and the Battle of Velasco.
The Convention of 1832 and 1833 aimed to discuss changes needed in Texas, including becoming a separate Mexican state and allowing U.S. immigration.
Stephen F. Austin was chosen to deliver these resolutions to Mexico City, but was later imprisoned for encouraging Texans to form their own government.
After his release in 1835, Austin returned to Texas, where reforms began due to the cholera outbreak and Santa Anna's repeal of the law restricting U.S. immigration.
Austin's imprisonment and eventual release marked a significant period in the tensions between Mexico and Texas during this time.

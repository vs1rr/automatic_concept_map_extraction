The State of Coahuila y Tejas, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, began its constitutional tradition under the Mexican Constitution of 1824.
Influenced by the United States and Spanish constitutions, the new state of Coahuila y
Tejas developed its own constitution in 1827, which included elements such as the establishment of Catholicism as the state religion and the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.
The state legislature was unicameral, with Texas being one of the three districts in the state.
The constitution also incorporated Spanish legal traditions, such as the community property system and the homestead exemption from bankruptcy, which provided stability for frontier families.
Additionally, the constitution included provisions for promoting education.
However, discontent with misgovernment in Texas and political unrest in Mexico led to a new convention in 1833 that drafted a constitution for Texas as an independent state.
When Stephen F. Austin delivered this constitution to Mexico City, he was imprisoned, marking a turning point in the tensions between Texas and the Mexican government.

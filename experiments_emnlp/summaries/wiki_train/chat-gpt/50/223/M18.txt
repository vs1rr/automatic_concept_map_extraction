Byzantine Empire was the predominantly Greek-speaking continuation of the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, with its capital city in Constantinople.
The empire survived the fragmentation of the Western Roman Empire and thrived for a thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.
The empire was a powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe, with a transition period in the 4th to 6th centuries marking the division of the Roman Empire into east and west.
Under rulers like Diocletian, Constantine I, Theodosius I, and Heraclius, the empire underwent significant changes, adopting Greek as the official language and Orthodox Christianity as the state religion.
The borders of the empire evolved over time, with periods of decline and recovery, such as during the reign of Justinian I, who reconquered much of the western Mediterranean coast.
The empire experienced a renaissance under the Macedonian dynasty but faced a decline in the final centuries, leading to its eventual annexation by the Ottomans.
The term "Byzantine Empire" was coined in the 16th century to distinguish it from ancient Rome and reflect its Greek orientation and Orthodox Christian culture.
The empire's art, architecture, and influence spread throughout Europe and the Near East, leaving a lasting legacy in the development of Western art and architecture.

Chapter 7 of the text discusses Late Antiquity, specifically focusing on the Byzantine Empire from 350-600.
Despite efforts by Constantine and Justinian, the unity of the Roman Empire could not be maintained, and Byzantium faced assaults from various groups such as Germanic tribes, Persians, Huns, Bulgars, Avars, and Arabs.
The Byzantine Empire's strength came from strong military leadership, the fortifications of Constantinople, and the Law Code of Justinian, which was a significant contribution to the early Middle Ages and the foundation of European law.
Byzantine intellectual life passed on Greco-Roman culture to the Arabs and kept learning alive in the East.
In terms of science and medicine, Byzantines made advances in military uses but struggled with the Justinian plague.
The growth of the Christian Church saw the legalization of Christianity by Constantine, the development of the Nicene Creed, and the emergence of the Orthodox Church, which was less independent of secular control than the western Christian church.
The development of Christian monasticism saw the rise of St. Anthony and St. Basil, with Western and Eastern monasticism differing in their practices.
Christian ideas and practices absorbed classical culture but also held negative views on women and sexuality.
Saint Augustine had a significant impact on early Christianity, and missionaries worked to spread Christianity throughout Europe, including the British Isles.
The idea of the barbarian was shaped by the Greeks and Romans, and Germanic kingdoms were established between 450 and 565, with the Franks proving to be the most powerful.
Anglo-Saxon England saw the establishment of seven Germanic kingdoms known as the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy, which were later united under Alfred the Great.
Barbarian society was based on kinship, custom, and class, with Germanic law focusing on fines paid to control violence rather than achieve justice.
Social and economic structures in Germanic society were patriarchal, with warfare being endemic.

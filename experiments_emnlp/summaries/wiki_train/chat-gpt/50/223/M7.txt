In 1453, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople, fell to Sultan Mehmed II and his Ottoman Turks after a fifty-day siege.
The Turks used various war tactics, including huge cannons, warships, and infantry, to breach the city's defenses.
The first attack was led by the Bashi-bazouks, followed by the Anatolian Turks and then the Janissaries.
The Turks eventually found a weak spot in the city's defenses at the Kerkoporta gate and were able to enter the city.
Meanwhile, the Turks also attacked the city from the sea, with ships in the Golden Horn and off the Marmora shore aiding the land troops.
Once the city was taken, Mehmed renamed it Istanbul and began building mosques, palaces, and monuments.
New rules were imposed on the conquered Greeks, who were allowed to form communities within the empire called milets, while Christians were permitted to practice their religion but had to wear distinguishing attire and could not bear arms.
The fall of Constantinople marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in the city's history under Ottoman rule.

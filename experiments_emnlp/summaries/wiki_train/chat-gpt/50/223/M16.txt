The Byzantines, who bridged the Classical and Post-Classical era, were a powerful economic force in the Mediterranean for nearly a thousand years, with Constantinople as their capital.
They were known for their religious buildings and art, including the famous Hagia Sophia.
The Byzantine Empire reached its greatest extent in the 6th century under Justinian, but fell to the Turks in 1453.
The Turks, who have a history spanning over 4,000 years, first settled in Anatolia in the 11th century and established the Anatolian Seljuk State.
This state enriched Anatolia with mosques, universities, and other monumental structures.
The collapse of the Seljuk Empire led to the emergence of various Turkish beyliks, one of which was the Ottoman Beylik.
The Ottomans eventually united the Turkish beyliks and established the Ottoman Empire, capturing Constantinople in 1453 and ending the reign of the Byzantine Empire.
The era of the Byzantines and the rise of the Turks in Anatolia are significant periods in history that have left a lasting impact on the region.

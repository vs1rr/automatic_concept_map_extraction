The Byzantine Empire was the Greek-speaking continuation of the Roman Empire, lasting from 324 to 1453.
Its capital was Constantinople, originally known as Byzantium.
The empire was a powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe for most of its existence.
It went through cycles of decline and recovery, reaching its greatest extent under Justinian I in the 6th century.
The empire faced challenges from the Muslim conquests in the 7th century and the Seljuk Turks in the 11th century.
The Fourth Crusade in 1204 led to the sack of Constantinople, but the empire was briefly restored in 1261.
However, the empire continued to decline, facing financial difficulties and threats from the Ottoman Turks.
In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire.
The empire's legacy includes its role in preserving Greek culture and Orthodox Christianity, as well as its influence on European history.

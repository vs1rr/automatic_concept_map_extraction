Constantinople, also known as Byzantium, New Rome, and Istanbul, was the capital city of the Eastern Roman Empire after the fall of Rome.
Founded by Constantine in the early 4th century, the city was strategically located on a promontory between the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn bay, with natural defenses on three sides and walls built on the landward side.
The city was surrounded by water and had a double line of protective fortifications stretching from the Sea of Marmara to the Golden Horn.
The Theodosian walls, completed in the 5th century, marked the limits of the "Old City" and were a significant defensive structure.
Constantinople was built on rocky terrain and claimed 7 hills, similar to Rome.
The city was known for its forums, including those built by Constantine, Arcadius, Theodosius, Marcia, and Leo.
The geographic coordinates of Constantinople are 41° 0' 16" N and 28° 58' 14" E. The city's name changed over time, from Byzantium to Nova Roma to Constantinople to Istanbul.
Constantinople played a crucial role in the history of the Eastern Roman Empire and was a major center of trade and culture in the region.

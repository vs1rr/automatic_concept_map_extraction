The Byzantine-Sassanid War (602-628) was the final and most significant conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires.
The war began in 602 when Khosrau II invaded Byzantine land in response to the execution of his ally, Emperor Maurice, by Phocas.
The Sassanids had early successes, capturing several frontier towns and cutting the Byzantine Empire in half by conquering Syria and Jerusalem.
In 618, the Sassanids captured Egypt, prompting Emperor Heraclius to raise a new army and take command himself.
Heraclius won a decisive victory over the Sassanids in 622, but faced challenges from the Avars and Slavs in the north.
In 624, Heraclius invaded Sassanid territory and won several battles, forcing Khosrau to raise more armies.
In 626, the Sassanids attempted to besiege Constantinople but were repelled by the Byzantines and their allies, the Khazars.
Heraclius then made an alliance with the Turks and invaded the Sassanid Empire, defeating Khosrau at Nineveh in 627.
Khosrau was overthrown, and peace was eventually established.
The war had devastating consequences for both empires, with widespread destruction and loss of life.

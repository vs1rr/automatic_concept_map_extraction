The text discusses the California Gold Rush, which began after James W. Marshall discovered gold in Suttler's Mill in 1848.
Marshall, an American carpenter, was driven from his land by gold diggers and never benefited from his discovery.
The news of the gold discovery attracted over 300,000 gold-seekers, known as "forty-niners," from around the world.
The influx of migrants from countries like Mexico, Peru, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, and China led to population growth and development in California.
However, the gold rush also had negative consequences, including the displacement of Native Americans, racial tensions, and environmental problems caused by gold extraction

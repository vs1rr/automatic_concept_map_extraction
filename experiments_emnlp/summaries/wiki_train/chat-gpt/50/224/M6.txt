The Gold Rush in California began after gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill by James Marshall in 1848.
John Sutter, a Swiss emigrant, had received a land grant in Sacramento Valley and built Sutter's Fort, which became a rest station for travelers and immigrants.
When the discovery of gold was confirmed, word spread quickly across the country, and President James Polk confirmed the accounts of gold in California to Congress.
The news of the discovery of gold in California became national news, leading to a massive influx of prospectors and immigrants to the region in search of their fortune.

During Lent, Christians are often encouraged to journey into the desert with Jesus, following his 40 days of temptation in the wilderness.
This journey symbolizes leaving Egypt behind, as the Israelites did after their exodus.
Ancient Egypt was a powerful civilization, known for its advancements in various fields.
For the Israelites, Egypt represented both luxury and enslavement.
Some Church Fathers interpret their enslavement as a symbol of our own bondage to sin and passions.
As we enter Lent, we are called to leave behind the comforts and temptations of Egypt, relying on God for sustenance and strength.
Fasting and abstinence during Lent remind us of our dependence on God and help us break free from sinful habits.
Just as the Israelites had to trust in God for their basic needs in the desert, we are called to trust in Him during Lent and strive for a holy life, leaving behind the enslavement of sin.
Lent is a time to renew our commitment to God and separate ourselves from the comforts and temptations of Egypt.

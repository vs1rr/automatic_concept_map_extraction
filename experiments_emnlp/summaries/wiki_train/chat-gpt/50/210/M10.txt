Ancient Egypt is a civilization that dates back over 6,000 years, with its roots in settled life along the Nile River.
The unification of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt in the third millennium B.C. marked the beginning of the Pharaonic Age, with power centralized in the hands of a god-king.
The ancient Egyptians were pioneers in various fields, including belief in life after death, stone architecture, writing, and shipbuilding.
The Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and Second Intermediate Period saw periods of strong central government, pyramid building, and divine kingship.
The New Kingdom reached the peak of Egyptian power, wealth, and territory, with Pharaoh Thutmose III expanding Egypt's borders.
The Late Period saw Egypt under pressure from other civilizations, with the Persian occupation marking the end of pharaonic civilization.
Throughout its history, Egypt's culture and society were shaped by its unique geographical and cultural unity, as well as its strong sense of identity and pride in its heritage.

Ancient Egypt was a preeminent civilization in the Mediterranean world for almost 30 centuries, from around 3100 B.C. to 332 B.C.
The field of Egyptology has been created by the study of the many monuments, objects, and artifacts that have been recovered from archaeological sites, covered with hieroglyphs that have only recently been deciphered.
The culture of ancient Egypt was known for its beauty of art, accomplishment of architecture, and richness of religious traditions.


The Predynastic Period, from around 5000-3100 B.C., saw the gradual development of the Egyptian civilization, with Neolithic communities in northeastern Africa making advances in agriculture, arts, crafts, technology, politics, and religion.
Around 3400 B.C., two separate kingdoms were established, the Red Land in the north and the White Land in the south, with King Menes eventually unifying the country and becoming the first king of the first dynasty.


The Archaic Period, from around 3100-2686 B.C., saw the development of the foundations of Egyptian society, including the ideology of kingship and the earliest known hieroglyphic writing.
The Old Kingdom, from around 2686-2181 B.C., was known as the Age of the Pyramid Builders, with the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza for Khufu, Khafra, and Menkaura.
The kingdom enjoyed a golden age of peace and prosperity during the third and fourth dynasties, but faced challenges in the fifth and sixth dynasties, leading to the collapse of the Old Kingdom.


The First Intermediate Period, from around 2181-2055 B.C., was a time of chaos and civil war following the collapse of the Old Kingdom.
The Middle Kingdom, from around 2055-1786 B.C., saw the reunification of Egypt under the 11th dynasty and a period of prosperity, colonization, and pyramid-building.
The Second Intermediate Period, from around 1786-1567 B.C., saw the invasion of the Hyksos and the eventual expulsion of foreign rulers from Egypt.


The New Kingdom, from around 1567-1085 B.C., saw the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I and the establishment of a great empire stretching from Nubia to the Euphrates River.
The period was notable for powerful kings such as Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Amenhotep III, and Queen Hatshepsut.
The reign of Amenhotep IV, later known as Akhenaton, saw a religious revolution and the exclusive worship of the sun-god Aton.
The New Kingdom also saw the construction of great temples and cities, with the kings being buried in the Valley of the Kings.


The Third Intermediate Period, from around 1085-664 B.C., saw changes in Egyptian politics, society, and culture, with the resurgence of local officials and the influence of foreigners from Libya and Nubia.
The period saw the establishment of the 22nd dynasty and the rule of Nubian pharaohs from the 25th dynasty.
The period ended with the Persian conquest of Egypt in 332 B.C. by Alexander the Great, leading to centuries of Roman rule and the eventual introduction of Christianity as the official religion.


Overall, ancient Egypt was a civilization known for its art, architecture, and religious traditions, with periods of prosperity, turmoil, and foreign conquest shaping its history over the centuries.

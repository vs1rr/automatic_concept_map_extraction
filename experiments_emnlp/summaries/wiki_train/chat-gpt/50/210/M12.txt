The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt, lasting from 1070-712 B.C., was a time of politically divided rule and diffused power following the death of Ramesses XI.
The period can be divided into three stages, with Dynasty 21 ruling from Tanis in the eastern Delta and the High Priests of Amun ruling from Thebes during the first stage.
The second stage saw a powerful family of Libyan descent ruling in the eastern Delta, with pharaohs of Libyan origin ruling as native Egyptians.
The final stage, Dynasty 23, emerged in the eastern Delta, governing Egypt simultaneously with Dynasty 22.
By the end of the eighth century B.C., Egypt had fragmented further, with various local rulers holding sway in different regions.


During the Third Intermediate Period, Egypt gradually lost control of Nubia to the south, with an independent native dynasty ruling from Napata and extending its influence into southern Egypt.
In 729 B.C., the Nubian king Piankhy invaded Egypt and established Nubian rule for seventy-five years.
The weakening of centralized royal authority during this period led to the emergence of the temple network as a dominant sphere for political aspirations, social identification, and artistic production.
Temple precincts became favored burial sites, with elaborate burial equipment and coffins showcasing the highest quality craftsmanship.


Artistically, the Third Intermediate Period saw the creation of stylistically and technologically innovative bronze and precious temple statuary, as well as relief-decorated vessels and small objects in faience and precious metal.
The theme of the king as the child/son of a divine pair became prominent, expressed in various artistic forms.
The period also saw the emergence and development of the mammisi, or birth house, a subordinate temple where the birth of a juvenile god identified with the sun god and the king was celebrated.


Overall, the Third Intermediate Period in Egypt was a time of political fragmentation, cultural change, and artistic innovation.
The period laid the foundation for developments in art and culture that would continue throughout the first millennium.
The temple network became a central focus for political and artistic expression, with elaborate burial practices and artistic creations reflecting the changing dynamics of Egyptian society during this time.

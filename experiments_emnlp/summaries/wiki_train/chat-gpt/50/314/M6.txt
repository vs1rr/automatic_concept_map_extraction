The CSI Effect refers to the belief that forensic science television dramas, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, influence jurors to expect more forensic evidence in criminal cases.
While police and prosecutors are concerned about the unrealistic portrayal of forensic science on TV shaping public expectations, empirical research has not conclusively proven the existence of the CSI Effect.
Some studies suggest that viewers of CSI may have higher expectations for scientific evidence, but this does not necessarily impact their propensity to convict.
Instead, there may be more of a "tech effect" where jurors are influenced by advances in technology in their own lives.
Despite concerns about the CSI Effect, it has led to an increase in the number of universities offering forensic science degrees and students pursuing those degrees.
Overall, while the impact of forensic science television dramas on the criminal justice system is still debated, it has certainly raised awareness and interest in the field of forensic science.

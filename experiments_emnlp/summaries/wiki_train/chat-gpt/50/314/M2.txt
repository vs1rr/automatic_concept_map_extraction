The "CSI effect" is a concern in the criminal justice system as popular TV shows like "CSI" and "NCIS" exaggerate forensic science, leading jurors to have unrealistic expectations of evidence in court.
This phenomenon has been fueled by the increased focus on forensic science in media, creating a demand for more evidence during investigations.
The portrayal of quick and advanced forensic techniques on TV has raised public expectations of real-life forensic scientists and detectives.
However, the reality is that forensic analysis takes time and is not as straightforward as shown on television.
These exaggerated portrayals can also provide potential criminals with ideas on how to cover their tracks.
The question arises whether the entertainment value of these crime shows should be sacrificed in order to prevent criminals from using them as a guide.
It is up to viewers to decide whether producers should tone down the scientific exaggeration in these shows or if the entertainment value outweighs the potential negative impact on the criminal justice system.

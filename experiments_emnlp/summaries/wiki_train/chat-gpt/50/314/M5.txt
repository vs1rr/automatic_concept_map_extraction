The CSI effect refers to the unrealistic public perception of forensic science's effectiveness and availability in the criminal justice system, influenced by crime scene television dramas like CSI.
These shows have raised juror expectations for forensic evidence, altered prosecutorial behavior, and portrayed forensic scientists as infallible.
However, the public is able to distinguish between fact and fiction, understanding that TV shows are for entertainment rather than education.
While these shows may satisfy viewers' emotional demands for closure and justice, they do not necessarily create unrealistic expectations for real forensic science capabilities.
The media's influence on public perception and behavior is limited, as people can differentiate between TV portrayals and reality.
Overall, the CSI effect may not significantly impact the public's understanding of science and technology, as viewers are aware of the distinction between entertainment and real-life forensic science practices.
The public's expectations for quick resolutions and justice served within a short time frame, as seen on TV, may not necessarily translate to real-life situations.
In conclusion, while forensic science dramas may enhance entertainment value, they do not necessarily diminish the public's understanding of real forensic science capabilities.

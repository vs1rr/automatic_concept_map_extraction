The field of art conservation is experiencing a shift towards a more scientific approach, similar to the "CSI Effect" seen in the legal field.
This trend is reflected in the training of art conservators, where technical know-how is prioritized over historical knowledge and artistic skill.
Undergraduate programs in art conservation often lack a strong emphasis on art history and studio art, focusing instead on chemistry and materials science.
Graduate programs, such as those at the University of Delaware, place a greater emphasis on art history and require practical experience in addition to coursework.
However, there is a lack of advanced studio training at the graduate level, which is concerning as artistic ability is crucial for restorers.
The field of art conservation is described as a three-legged stool, with each leg representing different areas of knowledge required for a solid foundation.
While programs like the one at Delaware understand the need for intensive training, there is a growing concern that scientific knowledge is overshadowing other considerations in ensuring the preservation of artistic heritage.
It is important for conservators, art historians, artists, and the general public to trust their eyes and not rely solely on scientific knowledge in the conservation of art.

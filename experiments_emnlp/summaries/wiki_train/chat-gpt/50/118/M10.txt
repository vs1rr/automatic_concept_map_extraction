Brougham Castle in Cumbria was built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vieuxpont, strategically located between the rivers Lowther and Eamont.
The castle was confiscated by the Crown in 1264 but eventually returned to the de Vieuxpont family.
In 1269, it came into the ownership of the de Clifford family through marriage.
The castle saw improvements during the Anglo-Scottish War, with stone defenses and a new gatehouse added.
Robert de Clifford, who held the title of Lord of the Marches, died at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.
The castle was briefly captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388.
By 1592, it was in disrepair under the ownership of Sir George Clifford.
In the early 17th century, the castle underwent restoration and James I was entertained there in 1617.
Lady Anne Clifford inherited the castle in 1643 and oversaw a period of restoration at Brougham and other family castles.
She died in 1676, after which the castle fell into ruin under the ownership of the Lord of Thanet.
In the 1930s, the castle passed into state ownership and is now managed by English Heritage, open to the public.
Lady Anne Clifford was the last member of the Clifford family to live at Brougham Castle, spending time at various family castles before her death.
The castle's decline was due to the Lord of Thanet's focus on maintaining Appleby Castle instead.
Today, Brougham Castle stands as a historic site for visitors to explore and learn about its rich history.

Brougham Castle, located near Penrith, is a historical site with roots dating back to a Roman fort.
Originally built in the early 13th century by the Norman family of Robert de Vieuxpont, the castle passed to the Clifford family in 1268.
Over the years, the castle underwent various renovations to strengthen its defenses, including the addition of stone walls and a gatehouse.
The castle played a significant role in the Anglo-Scottish wars and hosted King Edward 1 in 1300.
However, in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked by the Scots.
The Clifford family eventually spent more time at their other castles, leading to Brougham Castle falling into disrepair by 1592.
Lady Anne Clifford inherited the castle in 1643 and worked to restore it, maintaining it until her death in 1676.
The castle was later sold and left to decay, inspiring works by artists like J M W Turner and poets like William Wordsworth.
In the 1930s, Brougham Castle was taken over by the Ministry of Works and is now maintained by English Heritage.
Visitors can explore the castle, learn about its history through an introductory exhibition, and view carved tombstones from the nearby Roman fort.

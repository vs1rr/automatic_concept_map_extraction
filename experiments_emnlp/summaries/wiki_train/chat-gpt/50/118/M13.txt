Brougham Castle was built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vieuxpont to defend against King John's enemies in the north of England and Scotland.
The castle was strategically located on the banks of the rivers Eamont and Lowther, controlling important road crossings.
The site had previously been used by the Romans for similar purposes.
Over the years, the castle underwent various upgrades and expansions under different owners, including Robert Clifford and his grandson Roger Clifford.
Despite these improvements, the castle was captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388.
It fell into disuse until 1421 when a man was accused of forging coins within its walls.
The castle's history reflects the ongoing Anglo-Scottish wars that lasted for centuries.
Today, Brougham Castle stands as a historic site, showcasing the architectural and strategic significance of medieval castles in the region.

Brougham Castle, located in a picturesque setting beside the River Eamont, dates back to the early 13th century and was built on the site of a Roman fort.
Initially constructed by Robert de Vipont, the castle was later expanded and fortified by the Clifford family.
The castle was sacked by Scots in 1388 and suffered damage from a fire in 1521.
Lady Anne Clifford, who inherited the castle in 1649, spent the last years of her life restoring it and other family properties.
Visitors can explore the castle towers for impressive views and see a fragment of a Roman tombstone with an inscription.
The best views of the castle can be seen from a small bridge across the River Eamont.
Nearby is the partially restored Brougham Hall.
Brougham Castle is located 1.5 miles southeast of Penrith in Cumbria, England, with limited parking available.
The castle is managed by English Heritage and offers a glimpse into medieval history and the life of Lady Anne Clifford.

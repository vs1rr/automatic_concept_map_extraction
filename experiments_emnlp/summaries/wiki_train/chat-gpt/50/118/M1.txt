Brougham Castle is located next to the River Eamont on the site of an old Roman fort, Brocavum.
Built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vipont, the castle underwent significant changes over the years, including additions by Roger Clifford and his son Robert, who improved its defensive properties and accommodations.
The castle was later captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388.
Lady Anne Clifford, the last member of the Clifford family to live at the castle, restored many of the family properties before her death in 1676.
The castle eventually fell into ruin after being sold by the Earl of Thanet, who chose to focus on his castle at Appleby.
Brougham Castle is now open to the public and managed by English Heritage.
Located 1.5 miles southeast of Penrith in Cumbria, visitors can explore the castle and learn about its rich history.

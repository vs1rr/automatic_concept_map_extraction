The Old Library in Dublin, Ireland is home to the Book of Kells, a famous illuminated manuscript dating back to around 800 AD.
The library also displays pages from other ancient works such as the Book of Armagh and the Book of Mulling.
The Book of Kells is known for its intricate decoration and is believed to have originated from a monastery on Iona, Scotland.
Despite being raided multiple times, the book survived and was eventually taken to Dublin for safekeeping.
The 340 calfskin folios contain the four New Testament gospels and elaborate illustrations influenced by various cultures.
The library's Long Room, built in the 18th century, houses a vast collection of books and historical artifacts, including a fifteenth-century harp and the original printing of the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic.
Trinity College, where the library is located, has the right to claim a free copy of all British and Irish publications since 1801.
The library's exhibitions and displays offer visitors a glimpse into Ireland's rich literary and historical heritage.

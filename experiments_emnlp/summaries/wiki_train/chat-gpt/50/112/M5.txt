The Book of Kells, also known as the Book of Columba, is a famous illuminated manuscript created by Celtic monks around AD 800 in the style of Insular art.
It is named after the Abbey of Kells in Ireland, where it was kept for much of the medieval period.
The exact date and place of production of the manuscript have been the subject of debate, with theories suggesting it was created at Iona and finished at Kells, or possibly in the north of England.
The book contains the four gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, along with prefaces, summaries, and concordances of gospel passages.
The manuscript consists of 340 folios, with some folios believed to be lost.
The text is based on the Vulgate but contains numerous variants, suggesting the scribes may have relied on memory rather than the exemplar.
The manuscript is written in Insular majuscule, with some minuscule letters, and is accompanied by intricate full-page artwork and decorations in a broad palette of colors.
Despite the lavish nature of the work, there is no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript.
The Book of Kells is considered one of the most elaborate and well-preserved examples of Insular art, with ten surviving full-page illuminations and numerous smaller decorations scattered throughout the text.

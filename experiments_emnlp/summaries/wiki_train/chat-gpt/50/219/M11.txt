Britain's journey towards developing nuclear weapons began with critical breakthroughs in the early 1940s, leading to the formation of the MAUD Committee and collaboration with the U.S. and Canada during WWII.
After the war, Prime Minister Clement Attlee established a secret Cabinet committee on atomic energy to set nuclear policy.
Physicist William G. Penney, a key member of the British Mission at Los Alamos, played a crucial role in the development of Britain's atomic weapons program.
The program, code named Basic High Explosive Research (BHER), was based at Woolwich Arsenal and involved multiple research sites.
Construction of nuclear reactors and plutonium processing plants began in the late 1940s, with the first British nuclear test, code named Hurricane, conducted in 1952 on the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Australia.
The test, involving a plutonium implosion bomb, was successful and marked Britain's entry into the nuclear weapons club.

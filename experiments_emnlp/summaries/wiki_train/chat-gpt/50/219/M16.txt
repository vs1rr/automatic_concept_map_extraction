The Manhattan Project was a top-secret American effort during World War II to produce the first atomic bomb.
It was initiated after Albert Einstein warned President Franklin Roosevelt about the possibility of the Nazis creating their own atomic bombs.
The project involved key figures such as Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, and Vannevar Bush, and was approved by leaders like Winston Churchill and William Lyon Mackenzie King.
The project began in 1941 and led to the testing and subsequent dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in 1945, ultimately leading to Japan's surrender and the end of WWII.
The Manhattan Project marked the beginning of the nuclear age and had a significant impact on the future development of atomic weapons globally.
The project also involved international collaboration, with Canada contributing uranium for the bomb.
The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were controversial, with some questioning whether they were necessary to end the war.
The project also had its share of espionage, with Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs working on the project and later being sentenced to prison for passing on confidential information.
Overall, the Manhattan Project was a pivotal moment in history that changed the course of warfare and international relations.

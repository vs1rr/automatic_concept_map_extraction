The Manhattan Project was a U.S. government research project that took place from 1942 to 1945 and resulted in the creation of the first atomic bombs.
The project was initiated by American scientists, many of whom were refugees from fascist regimes in Europe, who recognized the military potential of the fission process.
The project began with a conference between Enrico Fermi and the Navy Department in 1939, and Albert Einstein presented the military potential of an uncontrolled fission chain reaction to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939.
The project received funding in 1940 and was put under the direction of the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1941.


After the U.S. entered World War II, the War Department became jointly responsible for the project, and the Manhattan District of the Army Corps of Engineers was assigned to manage the construction work.
Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves was placed in charge of all Army activities related to the project.
The project, known as the Manhattan Project, involved research and development of multiple methods to separate uranium-235, the essential fissionable component of the bomb, from uranium-238.
The project also focused on the production of plutonium-239, another fissionable material.


The project required the construction of large facilities and the development of complex processes to produce the necessary materials for the bombs.
The methods used for uranium separation included the electromagnetic process developed at the University of California, Berkeley, and the diffusion process developed at Columbia University.
The production of plutonium-239 involved transmutation in a reactor pile at the University of Chicago.
The project also required the development of methods to reduce fissionable products to pure metal and fabricate them into the required shapes for the bombs.


In 1943, a laboratory directed by J. Robert Oppenheimer was established at Los Alamos, New Mexico, to work on the design and functioning of the bomb.
The laboratory developed methods for bringing together fissionable material to achieve a nuclear explosion and constructed a deliverable weapon that could be dropped from a plane.
By the summer of 1945, enough plutonium-239 had been produced for a nuclear explosion, and a field test of the bomb was scheduled.


The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, at the Alamogordo air base in New Mexico.
The explosion generated an explosive power equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT and resulted in a mushroom cloud extending to 40,000 feet.
The following month, two atomic bombs produced by the project were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, leading to the end of World War II.


Overall, the Manhattan Project was a monumental undertaking that involved the collaboration of scientists, engineers, and military personnel to develop the first atomic bombs.
The project required significant resources and complex processes to achieve its goal of creating a nuclear weapon.
The successful detonation of the first atomic bomb marked a turning point in history and had far-reaching consequences for the world.

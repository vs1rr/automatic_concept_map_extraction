The Manhattan Project was a top-secret research and development project undertaken by the United States during World War II to develop the atomic bomb before Germany or Japan.
The project was initiated in response to a warning from Albert Einstein about the potential for nuclear weapons.
The project was carried out in three secret scientific cities: Hanford, Oak Ridge, and Los Alamos.
The first atomic bombs were designed and built at Los Alamos, with the test site code-named Trinity.
The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, marking the beginning of the nuclear age.
The project produced three bombs, with two being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan's unconditional surrender.
The Manhattan Project remained classified for many years and was a significant milestone in nuclear development and warfare.
The project introduced the most destructive creation of warfare known to mankind and signified the beginning of an era of nuclear weapons and scientific discovery.
The decision to use the atomic bombs remains a controversial topic, with some scientists arguing against its use for ethical reasons.
The project had a lasting impact on global defense and the development of nuclear weapons.

Photographer Martin Miller captured haunting images of the remnants of the Manhattan Project, the mission to build the first atomic bomb, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington.
The project was initiated after Albert Einstein warned President Franklin D. Roosevelt about Nazi Germany's nuclear ambitions.
The Manhattan Project resulted in the development of 'The Gadget', the atomic bomb that was detonated in New Mexico in 1945.
Subsequently, bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to the end of World War II.
The sites where the bombs were developed were massive, with advanced processes like electromagnetic separation and plutonium production.
The Hanford site in Washington worked on creating plutonium on a large scale.
Despite efforts to minimize the environmental impact, the land cannot be fully restored.
The uranium and plutonium produced at these sites were used in bomb assembly in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
The Manhattan Project's achievements are marveled at, but also viewed with regret for the devastation they unleashed on the world.

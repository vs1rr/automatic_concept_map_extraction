The Manhattan Project was a collaborative effort between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada to build the atomic bomb.
While the US provided most of the labor and resources, the role of the British in the project was a subject of controversy.
In late 1942, as the US program shifted from research to production, James B. Conant, President of Harvard, argued that the US should limit British involvement in the project.
Conant believed that sharing information with the British would not significantly aid the war effort, as they were not producing fissile material.
He proposed restricting British participation to areas where they were already working, such as bomb design and reactors.
Despite concerns about potential complications, Conant argued that limiting information to the US would enhance secrecy and prevent the British from seeking postwar scientific and commercial prestige.
However, Winston Churchill's influence ultimately led to the Quebec Agreement, granting the British access to American research and a say in the use of the bombs.
While the British were largely excluded from certain aspects of the project, they made significant contributions at Los Alamos.
Conant's initial concerns about secrecy proved valid, as a member of the British delegation, Klaus Fuchs, later became a significant atomic spy.
Ultimately, the British involvement in the Manhattan Project had both positive and negative consequences, with their contributions balancing out the challenges of maintaining secrecy.

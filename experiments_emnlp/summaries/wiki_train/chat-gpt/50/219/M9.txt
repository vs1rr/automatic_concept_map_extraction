Otto Robert Frisch was an Austrian-British physicist known for his work on the atomic bomb.
Born in Vienna in 1904, he studied physics at the University of Vienna and later worked in Germany before moving to London in 1933 due to the rise of Adolf Hitler.
In 1938, he, along with his aunt Lise Meitner, explained the process of nuclear fission and coined the term.
During World War II, he worked with Rudolf Peierls to design the first theoretical mechanism for an atomic bomb.
Frisch later worked on the Manhattan Project and accurately determined the critical mass of uranium needed for the bomb.
After the war, he continued his work in nuclear physics and eventually retired in 1972.
He passed away in 1979, leaving behind a legacy in the field of physics.

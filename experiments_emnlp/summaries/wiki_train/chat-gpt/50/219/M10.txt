Seventy-five years ago, two physicists at the University of Birmingham, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, published a memorandum that laid the groundwork for the development of nuclear weapons.
The pair, who were refugees from the Nazis, outlined how a super bomb could be created, stating that it would be practically irresistible as a weapon.
With the support of Birmingham professor Mark Oliphant, who had transformed the physics department and secured funding for a cyclotron, Peierls and Frisch worked side by side for two years on their calculations.


Before coming to Birmingham, Frisch had been working in Denmark but had to flee due to the threat of Nazi invasion.
Peierls, on the other hand, was already known to Oliphant for his expertise in applied mathematics.
Their work was based on the groundbreaking research of Albert Einstein on quantum theory and relativity, which had revealed the immense energy that could be released from atomic disintegration.
Despite initial skepticism from other scientists, Peierls and Frisch's calculations showed that a relatively small amount of pure Uranium 235 could trigger a chain reaction with explosive results.


Their memorandum was quickly sent to the government, leading to the funding of research to develop a British version of the bomb.
Winston Churchill endorsed the plans in 1941, putting British scientists ahead of the Americans in the race to develop nuclear weapons.
The Manhattan Project was eventually born, with British assistance, and the bomb was successfully developed in time to end World War II.


The story of Peierls and Frisch's pivotal role in the invention of nuclear weapons is now being brought to the stage in a play called "Oppenheimer" by Tom Moreton-Smith.
The play delves into the personal cost of making history and sheds light on the behind-the-scenes drama of the Manhattan Project.
Despite the controversial nature of their work, the contributions of these two Birmingham-based physicists cannot be denied in shaping the course of history.

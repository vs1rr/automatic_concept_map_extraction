Old Pine Church, also known as Mill Church, Nicholas Church, and Pine Church, is a mid-19th century church located near Purgitsville, West Virginia.
It was constructed in 1838 as a nondenominational "union church" and may have served as a meeting place for Schwarzenau Brethren adherents.
The church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination by 1870, and in 1878, the congregation split into White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church.
Both congregations continued to use Old Pine Church until 1907.
The church underwent restoration in 1968 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
The church is a one-story log building with a pressed metal ceiling and pews dating back to 1857.
The adjoining cemetery contains approximately 200 interments, with the oldest gravestone dating back to 1834.
Old Pine Church continues to be used for community gatherings, funeral services, and an annual church service.

Brougham Castle, located next to the River Eamont on the site of an old Roman fort, was built by Robert de Vipont in the early 13th century.
Over the years, the castle underwent various improvements, including the addition of a new gatehouse complex, domestic buildings, and a stone curtain wall by Robert Clifford.
The castle was later captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388.
Lady Anne Clifford, the last member of the Clifford family to live at the castle, restored most of the Clifford properties before her death in 1676.
The castle eventually fell into ruin and became the property of the Earl of Thanet, who sold off the furnishings and fittings.
Brougham Castle is now open to the public and managed by English Heritage.
The castle's location is 1.5 miles southeast of Penrith off the A66, and visitors can find more information on the English Heritage website.

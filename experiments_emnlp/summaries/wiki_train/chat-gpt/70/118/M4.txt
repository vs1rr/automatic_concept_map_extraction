Brougham Castle is a medieval castle located in a picturesque setting beside the River Eamont, a few miles east of Penrith in England.
The castle dates back to the early 13th century, with Roman stones from the nearby fort being re-used in its construction.
Initially built by Robert de Vipont, the castle was later extended and fortified by the Clifford family.
The castle was sacked by Scots in 1388 and suffered damage from a fire in 1521.
Lady Anne Clifford, a notable inhabitant, spent her later years restoring the Clifford family properties, including Brougham Castle.
Visitors can explore the castle towers for impressive views and see a fragment of a Roman tombstone with an inscription.
The best views of the castle can be seen from across the River Eamont.
Nearby is the Countess Pillar, built by Lady Anne to mark her last parting place from her mother.
Brougham Castle is a popular tourist attraction and offers a glimpse into medieval history in a beautiful setting.

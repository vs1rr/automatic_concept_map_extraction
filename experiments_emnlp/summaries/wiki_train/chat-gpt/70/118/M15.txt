Brougham Castle, originally a Roman fort, was later taken over by the Norman family of Vieuxpont to build their castle.
The current Brougham Castle was founded by Hugh de Morville in the 12th century.
The castle fell into decay in the 13th century and was rebuilt in the 16th century by the 2nd Earl of Cumberland.
During the English Civil War, the Roundheads destroyed the castle's defenses.
Lady Anne Clifford inherited the castle in 1643 and spent the next 26 years rebuilding it.
She made Brougham Castle her home until her death in 1676.
After her death, the castle quickly fell into ruin.
Her grandson took stone from the castle for use on Appleby Castle.
Brougham Castle is one of the most impressive castles in Cumbria, overlooking the River Eamont.
It is a well-preserved ruin and is open to the public as an English Heritage site.
The castle is open daily from April to September and closed from November to March.

Brougham Castle, located near Penrith in Cumbria, England, was built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vieuxpont.
The castle features a stone keep with a hall on the first floor and the lord's chamber on the second floor.
Lady Anne Clifford, who restored the castle in 1643, stayed in the lord's chamber and eventually died there in 1676.
The castle, which was captured and damaged by the Scots in 1388, fell into disrepair by the time of the English Civil War.
Lady Anne Clifford also restored other castles, including Skipton, Pendragon, and Appleby Castles.
After her death, Brougham Castle passed to the Earls of Thanet, who allowed it to fall into ruin.
The castle is now in the care of English Heritage and is open to the public.
Brougham Castle offers visitors a glimpse into its rich history, from its origins as a Roman fort to its role in the English Civil War and its restoration by Lady Anne Clifford.

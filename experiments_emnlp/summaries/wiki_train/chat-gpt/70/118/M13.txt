Brougham Castle was built in the early 13th century by Robert de Vieuxpont to defend against King John's enemies in the north of England and their Scottish allies.
The castle was strategically located on the banks of the rivers Eamont and Lowther, controlling important road crossings and trade routes.
Over the years, the castle underwent various renovations and expansions under different owners, including Robert Clifford and his grandson Roger Clifford.
These improvements included the construction of a stone curtain wall, a gatehouse complex, and a new hall.
Despite these upgrades, the castle was captured and sacked by the Scots in 1388, leading to its abandonment for several years.
It wasn't until 1421 that the castle was mentioned again, when a man was accused of forging coins within its walls.
Brougham Castle's history is closely tied to the Anglo-Scottish wars that lasted for centuries, with the castle serving as a key defensive stronghold in the region.
Today, the ruins of Brougham Castle stand as a testament to its medieval past and the strategic importance it once held in the northern English landscape.

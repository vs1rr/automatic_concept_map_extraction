Brougham Castle, a 13th-century structure built on the site of a former Roman fort, was strategically located at the confluence of the Lowther and Eamont rivers to defend against King John's enemies.
Initially constructed by Robert de Vieuxpont, the castle saw various additions and improvements over the centuries, including a stone wall, gatehouse, and Tower of League.
The Clifford family owned the castle for four centuries, with Lady Anne Clifford playing a significant role in its restoration in the 17th century.
However, the castle fell into ruin after being sold off in the early 18th century.
William Wordsworth found inspiration in its decaying shell for his poem 'The Prelude'.
In 1928, the government took ownership of the castle, and since 1984, English Heritage has been preserving the historical site.
Brougham Castle is open to visitors during the summer months, offering a glimpse into its rich history and architectural significance.

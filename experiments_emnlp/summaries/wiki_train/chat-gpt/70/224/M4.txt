The California Gold Rush began in 1848 when James W. Marshall discovered gold in the American River.
This discovery led to a massive influx of immigrants, known as "'49ers," to California from all over the United States and other countries.
The population of California grew rapidly, leading to its incorporation into the Union as the 31st state in 1850.
The gold rush also sparked global emigration, with fortune-seekers coming from China, Germany, Chile, Mexico, Ireland, Turkey, and France.
The Chinese immigrants, in particular, adopted unique practices to protect their gold from bandits.
Ethnic tensions arose in California, leading to the enactment of the Foreign Miners Tax in 1850, which targeted foreign miners, especially the Chinese.
This tax was the beginning of a campaign by native-born white Americans to restrict Chinese immigration, culminating in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
Despite these tensions, the Gold Rush transformed California into one of the most ethnically diverse states in the Union by the mid-19th century.
The Gold Rush also led to the construction of the Panama Railway, the world's first transcontinental railroad, to speed up travel to California.
The Gold Rush forever changed the demographic landscape of California and had lasting effects on immigration and ethnic relations in the state.

The California Gold Rush began in 1848 when gold was discovered by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Lumber Mill in Coloma, California.
This event attracted 300,000 prospectors, known as "forty-niners," who sought instant wealth.
In 1852 alone, $80 million worth of gold was extracted.
The discovery occurred before Mexico formally ceded California to the United States in 1848.
President James Polk was in office during this time, and the California Gold Rush was a significant event during his presidency.
The map of the gold rush shows various locations where gold was discovered, including Sutter's Mill, Mormon Island, Bidwell's Bar, Weber's Creek, and Rich Bar.
The gold rush had a major impact on the history of California and the United States, with many individuals seeking their fortunes in the goldfields.
The California Gold Rush was a defining moment in American history, with thousands of people flocking to the region in search of riches.
The legacy of the gold rush can still be seen today in the culture and economy of California.

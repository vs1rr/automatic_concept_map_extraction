Rumors of gold in California had circulated for years before the Gold Rush, but it wasn't until gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill that the rush began.
John Sutter, a Swiss emigrant who arrived in California in 1839, received a land grant of 50,000 acres in Sacramento Valley and built Sutter's Fort.
In 1847, he hired James Marshall to build a sawmill at Coloma, where Marshall discovered gold on January 4, 1848.
Despite Sutter's efforts to keep the discovery a secret, word spread quickly, and by late 1848, it had become national news.
President James Polk confirmed the accounts of gold in California on December 5, 1848.
The discovery of gold brought prospectors from across the country to California, leading to the Gold Rush.

The Manhattan Project was a top-secret research and development project undertaken by the United States during World War II to develop the first atomic bombs.
The project was initiated in response to the threat of Germany developing nuclear weapons, as highlighted by a warning from Albert Einstein in 1939.
The project was led by the Army Corps of Engineers and involved over 30 different research and production sites, with the main facilities located in Hanford, Oak Ridge, and Los Alamos.
The first atomic bombs were designed and built at Los Alamos, with the test detonation taking place at Trinity site in New Mexico on July 16, 1945.
The project produced three bombs, with "Little Boy" and "Fat Man" being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively, leading to Japan's unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945.
The Manhattan Project remained classified for many years, and its legacy marked the beginning of the nuclear age and the development of nuclear weapons.
The decision to use the atomic bombs remains a controversial topic, with some scientists arguing against their use for ethical reasons.
The project's impact on global defense and scientific discovery is still felt today.

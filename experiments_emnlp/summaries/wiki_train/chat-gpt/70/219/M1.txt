The Manhattan Project was a collaborative effort between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada to build the atomic bomb.
The British played a significant role in pushing the US to take action with the MAUD report, and Canada provided uranium.
However, as the project shifted from research to production in late 1942, the question arose of whether the British should be included in the later phases.
James B. Conant, President of Harvard and chairman of the National Defense Research Committee, believed that the US should essentially abandon the British at this point.
He argued that sharing all information with the British would not further the war effort, as they were not producing fissile material.
Conant suggested restricting British involvement to areas where they were already working, such as bomb design and reactors, to prevent them from gaining access to sensitive information.
Despite concerns about potential complications, Conant believed that cutting the British out of the project would help maintain secrecy and control over important military secrets.
However, the British eventually gained full cooperation through the Quebec Agreement, allowing them access to American research and a say in the use of the bombs.
While the British were largely excluded from certain aspects of the project, they made significant contributions towards the practical realization of the bomb.
Conant's initial concerns about secrecy proved to be valid, as a member of the British delegation to Los Alamos, Klaus Fuchs, became a significant atomic spy.
Ultimately, the British involvement in the Manhattan Project had both positive and negative consequences, with their contributions balancing out the challenges of maintaining secrecy and control over sensitive information.

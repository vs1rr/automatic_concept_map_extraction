The Frisch–Peierls memorandum, written in March 1940 by Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls while working at the University of Birmingham, was the first technical exposition of a practical atomic weapon.
It contained new calculations about the critical mass needed for an atomic bomb, estimating it to be about 1 kilogram of uranium-235.
This estimate was later found to be too low.
The memorandum was given to Marcus Oliphant, who passed it on to Henry Tizard, leading to the formation of the secret MAUD Committee.
The document helped accelerate British and U.S. efforts towards bomb development during World War II.


The memorandum outlined the implications of their calculations, proposing that the best defense against such a weapon would be to develop one before Germany did so.
It also discussed the destructive power of a radioactive "super-bomb," comparing its energy release to that of 1000 tons of dynamite and warning of the widespread destruction and radioactive contamination it would cause.
The memo played a key role in shaping the policies of deterrence that would later define Cold War geopolitics.


The Frisch–Peierls memorandum ultimately led to the formation of the Tube Alloys project in Britain and the Manhattan Project in the United States, which culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The document is held in the Public Record Office at Kew and is considered a significant milestone in the development of atomic weapons.
Through their calculations and proposals, Frisch and Peierls played a crucial role in advancing atomic bomb research and shaping the course of history during World War II and beyond.

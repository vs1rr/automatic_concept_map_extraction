Britain was the first country to seriously study the feasibility of nuclear weapons, making critical breakthroughs in the field.
The MAUD Committee, founded in 1940, worked on fission bomb design and uranium enrichment.
Cooperation with the U.S. and Canada continued through WWII, leading to the Quebec Agreement in 1943.
After the war, Prime Minister Clement Attlee established a secret Cabinet committee on atomic energy to set nuclear policy.
Physicist William G. Penney, a key member of the British Mission at Los Alamos during the war, played a significant role in the development of Britain's atomic weapons program.
Penney led the effort to develop an atomic bomb, with the first test, code named Hurricane, taking place in 1952 on the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Australia.
The test was successful, marking Britain's entry into the nuclear weapons club.

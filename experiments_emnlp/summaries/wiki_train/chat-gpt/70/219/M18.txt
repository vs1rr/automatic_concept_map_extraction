The Manhattan Project was a U.S. government research project that took place from 1942 to 1945 and resulted in the creation of the first atomic bombs.
The project was initiated by American scientists, many of whom were refugees from fascist regimes in Europe, who recognized the military potential of the fission process in 1939.
The project was officially put under the direction of the Office of Scientific Research and Development in December 1941, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was tasked with constructing the necessary facilities for the scientists to carry out their research.


The project, known as the Manhattan Project, involved multiple lines of research and development that needed to be carried out simultaneously.
Methods for separating uranium-235, the essential fissionable component of the bomb, from uranium-238 were explored, including the electromagnetic process developed at the University of California, Berkeley, and the diffusion process developed at Columbia University.
Large facilities and significant amounts of electric power were required for these processes, which were put into production at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Plutonium-239, another fissionable material needed for the bomb, was produced using a method developed at the University of Chicago.
The production of plutonium-239 required the construction of large reactors, such as those at the Hanford Engineer Works in Washington.
The design and functioning of the bomb itself were largely theoretical until a laboratory directed by J. Robert Oppenheimer was established in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1943.


By the summer of 1945, enough plutonium-239 had been produced to conduct a field test of a nuclear explosive.
The first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, at the Alamogordo air base in New Mexico.
The explosion generated an explosive power equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT and resulted in a mushroom cloud extending to 40,000 feet.
The following month, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, leading to the end of World War II.


Overall, the Manhattan Project was a massive and complex research and development effort that involved scientists, engineers, and military personnel working together to create the first atomic bombs.
The success of the project had a significant impact on the course of history and marked the beginning of the nuclear age.

Photographer Martin Miller captured haunting images of the remnants of the Manhattan Project, the mission to build the first atomic bomb, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington.
The project was initiated after Albert Einstein warned President Franklin D. Roosevelt about Nazi Germany's nuclear ambitions.
The Manhattan Project resulted in the development of 'The Gadget', the atomic bomb that was detonated in New Mexico in 1945.
Subsequently, bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan's surrender.
The project cost two billion dollars and involved advanced processes such as electromagnetic separation and plutonium production.
The sites where the bombs were developed are now abandoned, serving as a reminder of the destructive power of nuclear weapons.
Despite the monumental achievements of the Manhattan Project, there is also a sense of regret for the devastation it unleashed on the world.
The Hanford site in Washington is now deactivated, and efforts are being made to minimize the environmental impact of plutonium production.
The legacy of the Manhattan Project continues to haunt civilization, reminding us of the consequences of nuclear warfare.

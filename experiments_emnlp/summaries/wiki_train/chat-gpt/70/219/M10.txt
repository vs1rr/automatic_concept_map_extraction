In 1941, University of Birmingham physicists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch published a memorandum outlining the possibility of creating a nuclear bomb.
This breakthrough, which was initially considered science fiction, was made possible by their calculations and access to the cyclotron at the university.
With the support of professor Mark Oliphant, who had transformed the physics department, the two refugees from Nazi Germany were able to work on this groundbreaking research.
Their calculations showed that a small amount of pure Uranium 235 could create a chain reaction leading to a nuclear explosion.
This information was quickly sent to the government, leading to the endorsement of plans to build a British version of the bomb by Winston Churchill.
The Americans later joined the effort, leading to the creation of the Manhattan Project and the development of the nuclear bomb that ultimately ended World War II.
The play "Oppenheimer" by Tom Moreton-Smith explores the personal cost of making history during the Manhattan Project.

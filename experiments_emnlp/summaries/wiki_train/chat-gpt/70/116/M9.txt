Bramshill House and Gardens, dating back to the early 17th Century, was built by Edward, 11th Baron Zouche of Harringworth.
It is a large Jacobean 'Prodigy' house with unique eccentricities, situated on a South West facing escarpment overlooking the River Hart valley.
The house has undergone various renovations and additions over the centuries, with the Cope family occupying it from 1703 to 1935.
The estate, now listed Grade I, includes 106ha of grounds within a larger Grade II* listed park spanning 240ha.
The park features historic landscape elements dating back to medieval times, including Lord Zouche's 17th Century park, tree avenues, and axial rides with veteran trees.
The house is surrounded by a man-made lake, lawns, mature trees, mixed woodland, walled gardens, and terraced areas that were once formal gardens.
During World War II, the house served as a maternity home for evacuee mothers and later as a residence for the exiled King of Romania and his family.
In 1953, the Home Office acquired the property for a National Police Training College, leading to the development of new buildings to the North West of the mansion.

Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, was an English diplomat known for his lone vote against the condemnation of Mary, Queen of Scots, and for organizing a stag-hunt where the Archbishop of Canterbury accidentally killed a man.
He was born on June 6, 1556, to George la Zouche, 10th Baron Zouche, and
Margaret Welby. Zouche was a royal ward under the care of William Cecil and admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, and Gray's Inn.
He married Eleanor Zouche in 1578, but they lived apart after the birth of their daughters Elizabeth and Mary.
Eleanor's father complained to Lord Burghley about Zouche's treatment of her.
After Eleanor's death in 1611, Zouche married Sarah Harrington, who had been widowed twice.

Zouche served as a Commissioner for the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, where he was the only Commissioner to offer dissent against the judgement.
He later became an Ambassador to Scotland, Lord President of the Council of Wales, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.
Zouche was also involved with the Virginia Company and had a keen interest in horticulture, maintaining a physic garden at his house in Hackney.
In 1605, he purchased the manor of Bramshill in Hampshire and built a mansion there.
In 1621, the Archbishop of Canterbury accidentally killed a gamekeeper during a stag-hunt at Bramshill, tarnishing his reputation.

Zouche died in 1625 after a period of illness, and his burial place is unknown.
The Barony of Zouche fell into abeyance between his daughters Mary and Elizabeth, but it was later revived in 1815 in favor of Cecil Bisshopp, 12th Baron Zouche.
In 1620, Zouche provided counsel in a case involving his secretary Samuel More, who sent his four children to America on the Mayflower as indentured servants.
Three of the children died during the first winter, leaving only Richard More alive.


Throughout his career, Zouche held various offices, including Ambassador to Scotland, Ambassador to Denmark, Deputy Governor of Guernsey, Lord President of the Council of Wales, and Privy Counsellor.
He was also involved in the Virginia Company, New England, and various commissions related to treasury, ecclesiastical causes, and land titles.
Zouche's legacy is marked by his diplomatic service, his independent stance during the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, and the unfortunate incident at Bramshill involving the Archbishop of Canterbury.

In 1923, a New York society girl, Miss Edna Hilton, married Captain Denzil Cope, heir of the ancient Cope family in England.
The Copes were known for owning the chest in which the tragic legend of "The Mistletoe Bride" took place.
The legend tells of a bride who disappeared on her wedding day and was found fifty years later in a chest, having died a slow and agonizing death.
After their marriage, Edna and Denzil moved to Bramshill House, where the chest was kept.
Strange occurrences and encounters with spectres were reported in the house, leading to rumors of haunting.
The legend of the Mistletoe Bride was a popular subject for poems and ballads, depicting the tragic fate of the bride.
The story of the bride's death in the chest continues to captivate the popular imagination, with the chest being exhibited to visitors at Bramshill Park for many years.
The newlywed couple later moved to Lovell Castle in Oxfordshire, where more haunting manifestations were said to occur.

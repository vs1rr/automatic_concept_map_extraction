Bramshill House is a historic mansion located in Bramshill, Hampshire, approximately 47 miles southwest of central London.
The original house was built in the 14th century by Sir John Foxley, and later underwent significant renovations and additions by various owners.
In the early 17th century, Baron Edward la Zouche purchased the property and began construction on the current Jacobean-style mansion.
The architecture of Bramshill House is considered one of the "glories of English architecture" and features Italian Renaissance influences.


The mansion is three stories high on the southern entrance side and two stories high on the north and east sides.
The exterior of the house is built of red brick with stone dressings, large mullion windows, and a carved parapet.
The north façade features a loggia with a central arched entrance, while the south façade is described as one of the most fanciful pieces of Jacobean design in England.
The east façade includes a Troco Terrace with a lawn and arcaded openings, while the west façade has multiple gables and sashed windows.


The interior of Bramshill House is richly furnished with period pieces, including large tapestries depicting historical figures and scenes.

The staircase on the north side of the hall features standards and balusters from Eversley Manor House.


The first floor of the mansion contains state rooms, the Long Gallery, and the Chapel Drawing Room.
The Long Gallery is 126.5 feet long and features a stucco ceiling and wooden chimneypiece.
The Chapel Drawing Room was created by reducing the size of the original chapel and contains an altar reredos with paintings by Alexander Rowan.
The mansion's grounds include an 18-acre lake and 25 acres of early 17th-century formal gardens.

In 1960, it became the location of the Police Staff College and later the European Police College.
Due to escalating maintenance costs, the property was sold to heritage property developers in 2014.
The mansion is also known for its reputed haunted history, with stories of ghosts, including a bride who locked herself in a chest on her wedding night.

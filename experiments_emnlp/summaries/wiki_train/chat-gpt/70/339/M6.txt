The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 were influential statements passed by the state legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia, written by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively.
These resolutions were in opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts passed by Congress during the Quasi War with France.
The resolutions established the theory of nullification and interposition, claiming that individual states could nullify federal laws deemed unconstitutional.
However, the resolutions were overwhelmingly rejected by other states, with some even viewing them as military threats.
The ideas underlying the resolutions later influenced the Nullification Crisis of 1832 and the Southern secession in the 1860s, but were decisively rejected during the Civil War.
The authorship of Jefferson and Madison remained secret for years, and the resolutions have since become landmark documents supporting the concept of states' rights.

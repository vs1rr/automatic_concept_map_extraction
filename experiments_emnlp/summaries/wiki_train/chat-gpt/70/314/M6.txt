The CSI Effect refers to the belief among law enforcement and prosecutors that forensic science television dramas, like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, influence jurors to expect more forensic evidence in order to convict defendants.
While these shows may shape public perceptions of crime solvers, empirical research has not substantiated the CSI Effect.
Some studies suggest that viewers of CSI may have higher expectations for scientific evidence, but this does not necessarily impact their willingness to convict.
Instead, jurors may be more influenced by technological advances in their own lives, expecting forensic science technology to keep up with consumer technology.
Despite concerns about the CSI Effect, it has not been proven to have a widespread impact on jury decisions.
The rise in popularity of forensic science television dramas has led to an increase in universities offering forensic science degrees and students pursuing those degrees.

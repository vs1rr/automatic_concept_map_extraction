The CSI effect refers to the unrealistic public perception of forensic science in the criminal justice system, influenced by crime scene television dramas like CSI.
These shows have raised juror expectations for forensic evidence, leading to changes in prosecutorial behavior and potentially educating criminals on how to avoid detection.
While TV forensic science dramas may satisfy viewers' emotional demands for closure and justice, they do not necessarily give the public an accurate understanding of real forensic science capabilities.
People are able to distinguish between fact and fiction, and while TV shows may present quick resolutions, this does not necessarily translate to real-life expectations.
Overall, the primary goal of TV shows is entertainment, not education, and viewers are aware of the distinction between what is portrayed on TV and reality.

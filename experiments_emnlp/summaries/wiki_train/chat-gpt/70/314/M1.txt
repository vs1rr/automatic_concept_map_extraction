The CSI Syndrome, also known as the CSI Effect or CSI Infection, refers to the exaggerated portrayal of forensic science on crime TV shows like CSI, influencing public perception.
The unrealistic depiction of investigators knowing everything and the emphasis on forensic evidence can lead to a decrease in the value of confessions and circumstantial evidence.
Additionally, criminals may learn how to better conceal evidence from watching these shows, making it harder for investigators to solve cases.
The CSI Syndrome gives a false impression of the importance of forensic evidence, despite its potential for manipulation.

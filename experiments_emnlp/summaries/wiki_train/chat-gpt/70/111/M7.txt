Bodiam Castle is a picturesque and evocative medieval ruin located in the heart of an historic landscape in Britain.
Built by Sir Edward Dallingridge in the 14th century, the castle features spiral staircases, battlements, and a surrounding moat.
After falling into disrepair following the English Civil War, Bodiam Castle was rescued and conserved by Lord Curzon, who left it to the National Trust in 1926.

Throughout the year, Bodiam Castle hosts various events such as the Cadbury Easter Egg Trail, archery lessons, and the Outlaw Academy during the Easter holidays.
During the Spring Half Term, visitors can play with medieval toys and games or participate in Happening History to make their own medieval toy.

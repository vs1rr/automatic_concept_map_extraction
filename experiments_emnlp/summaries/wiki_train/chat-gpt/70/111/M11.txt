Bodiam Castle, described as resembling a giant sandcastle, is a unique example of a Courtyard Castle built during the late medieval period in England.
It was constructed by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge, a powerful figure in Sussex, in response to the threat of French invasion.
The castle passed through various owners over the centuries, including the Lewknor and Hufton families.
In the 18th century, it fell into disrepair until it was rescued by John 'Mad Jack' Fuller, a local squire.
The castle was later sold to Lord Ashcombe, who undertook significant repairs.
In 1916, Lord Curzon purchased the castle and began a restoration project, eventually leaving it to The National Trust.
Today, Bodiam Castle is open to visitors and offers a glimpse into medieval history.
It is a popular destination for families and history enthusiasts, with guided tours, a gift shop, and a restaurant on site.
The castle's exterior remains well-preserved, providing a picturesque setting for visitors to explore.

Bruce Castle in Tottenham is the second most famous building in the area after White Hart Lane Stadium.
The manor originally belonged to Waltheof, Earl of Huntingdon, and eventually passed to the Bruce family, who built the original manor house in 1254.
The present house dates back to the early sixteenth century and has a rich history of hosting notable figures such as Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.
The house was known as 'The Lordship' until it was renamed by Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine.
The house has never had a military function and features a tower that was built to house falcons.
In the 19th century, the house became a school known for its progressive teaching methods.
Today, Bruce Castle is a museum with exhibitions on Haringey's history and Rowland Hill.
The house has undergone various renovations over the centuries to align with changing architectural styles, with the most significant changes occurring in the eighteenth century to reflect Georgian tastes.
The house's appearance in the late seventeenth century, eighteenth century, and nineteenth century is depicted in various drawings, showcasing its evolution over time.

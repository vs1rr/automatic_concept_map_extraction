Bruce Castle is a 16th century manor house in Tottenham, originally known as 'Lordship House'.
The site has been occupied since the early medieval period, with part of the land belonging to the 'de Bruce' family of Scotland in 1254.
William Compton, a close friend of Henry VIII, owned the site by 1514 and likely had a simple courtyard house there.
The Round Tower was built at this time, possibly for falconry.
In 1516, Henry VIII borrowed the manor house to meet his sister, Queen Margaret of Scotland.
The house was used as a refuge from the Plague at the end of the 1500s.
By 1626, the house and land were owned by Hugh Hare, 1st Lord Coleraine, who died in 1667 after choking on a turkey bone.
His son, Henry Hare, 2nd Lord Coleraine, inherited the house and his wife, Constantia Lucy, is said to have tragically died by jumping off a balcony with her child.
Henry Hare remodeled the house between 1682 and 1684, giving it the name 'Bruce Castle'.
The house passed through several owners, including James Townsend and John Eardley Wilmot, before being purchased by the Hill family in 1827.
The Hills opened a private boarding school for boys at Bruce Castle, which was visited by Charles Dickens and Charles Babbage.
The school closed in 1891, and the building became Tottenham's first public museum in 1906.
During World War II, the museum was used as a clinic and for exhibitions about the war effort.
Today, Bruce Castle is a Grade 1 listed building housing the London Borough of Haringey's archive and local history museum.

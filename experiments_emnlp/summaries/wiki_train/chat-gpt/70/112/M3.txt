The Book of Kells is a highly ornate and unique copy of the New Testament of the Bible, considered to be one of the most representative pieces of Celtic and Irish art.
Despite being a national symbol of Ireland and appearing on Irish currency, there is still controversy over its exact origins.
The Book of Kells is believed to have been created by Columban monks, possibly in Kells, Iona, or Northumberland.
The monks used vellum made from calfskin to create the folios of the book, which required the skins of over 185 calves.
The inks used in the Book of Kells were made from a variety of materials, resulting in a wide range of colors including yellow, red, green, purple, blue, brown, black, and white.
The intricate artwork and illuminations in the Book of Kells required precise and painstaking work, showcasing the beauty and complexity of Celtic art.
The book has been on display at Trinity College Library in Dublin since the mid-19th century, where it continues to be admired for its craftsmanship and historical significance.

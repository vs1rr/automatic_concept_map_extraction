The article discusses the idea that seventh- and eighth-century illuminators of Insular manuscripts, such as the Book of Kells, may have had knowledge of stereoscopic images, allowing them to create intricate and detailed designs.
The author suggests that these artists may have used their eyes as a camera lucida to copy designs and then as a stereocomparator to detect and minimize disparities between repetitions, resulting in microscopically detailed stereoscopic images.
The paper argues that this technique, known as free-fusion stereocomparison, could explain how these artists were able to achieve such detailed illumination centuries before the invention of magnifying lenses.
The author points to specific examples of Insular manuscripts associated with a family of monasteries known for their rapid proofreading abilities, suggesting that these artists may have used the proposed technique to create their intricate designs.
The article concludes that the use of free-fusion stereocomparison may have been a long-lost secret to achieving microscopically detailed illumination in Insular manuscripts, providing a new perspective on the artistic techniques of early medieval British Isles artists.

The Book of Kells is a famous illuminated manuscript written by monks in medieval Ireland over 1,200 years ago.
It contains the four gospels in Latin and is known for its intricate insular majuscule script and richly illuminated pages.
The book was originally kept in the monastery in Kells, Ireland, before being transferred to Trinity College Library in Dublin in 1661.
In 1990, exact facsimile replicas of the Book of Kells were published for a price of $14,800 each, with one replica being purchased by the Muskegon Irish-American Society and the Friends of Hackley Library for the Hackley Public Library.
The replica is on permanent display and the pages are turned weekly.
Donors who contributed to the purchase of the replica are listed in the display case.
The Library also offers a video and commentary volume for those interested in learning more about the Book of Kells.
It is believed to be the only facsimile edition of the Book of Kells on permanent display in a public library in North America.
Additional information about the Book of Kells can be found on various websites.

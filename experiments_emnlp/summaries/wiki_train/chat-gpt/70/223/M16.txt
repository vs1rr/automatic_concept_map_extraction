The Byzantine Empire, spanning from 600-1450 C.E., served as a bridge between the Classical and Post-Classical eras.
Established in 330 C.E. by Constantine, the Byzantines flourished in Constantinople for nearly a thousand years, showcasing impressive religious buildings and art, such as the renowned Hagia Sophia.
They were a dominant economic force in the Mediterranean until their conquest by the Turks in 1453.
The Turks, with a history dating back over 4,000 years, settled in Anatolia in the 11th century, eventually establishing the Anatolian Seljuk State after defeating the Byzantines at Malazgirt in 1071.
This state enriched Anatolia with mosques, universities, and other monumental structures, with notable figures like Rumi flourishing during this time.
Following the collapse of the Seljuk Empire, the Ottoman Beylik emerged and successfully united the Turkish beyliks in Anatolia, leading to the establishment of the Ottoman Empire.
The Ottomans captured Constantinople in 1453, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire.
This period of transition and cultural exchange between the Byzantines and Turks shaped the history and architecture of the region, leaving a lasting impact on the world.

The British Empire was the largest empire in history, with Britain being the leading global power for over a century.
It began in the 15th and 16th centuries with the establishment of overseas colonies for trade and financial benefit.
The empire grew to include territories in North America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia.
Despite facing opposition from France and the Netherlands, the empire continued to expand, adding Australia and New Zealand to its list of territories.
From 1815 to 1914, known as Britain's imperial century, the empire covered over 14 million square miles and had a population of 450 million.
With naval supremacy, Britain acted as a global policeman, controlling world trade and influencing economies in countries like China, Argentina, and Siam.
During Queen Victoria's reign, British ports were bustling with ships carrying goods from around the world, making Britain a wealthy nation.
However, the decline of the empire began in the early 20th century due to a loss of military and naval supremacy, as well as financial strain following World War II.
The United States and Russia emerged as superpowers, leading to the eventual dissolution of the British Empire.
The legacy of the British Empire is complex, with some viewing it as a force for good through the spread of democracy and self-government, while others criticize its exploitation of colonies for resources.
The British Empire included a vast number of countries during Victorian times, with control often changing hands and boundaries shifting.
The empire's influence extended to regions like Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, and the Pacific, leaving a lasting impact on the world.

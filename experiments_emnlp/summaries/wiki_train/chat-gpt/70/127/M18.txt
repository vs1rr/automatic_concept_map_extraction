Stone castles in Co.
Tipperary originated in the 12th century to control the surrounding area.
Early castles were made of earth and timber but were later replaced with stone for defense.
Construction required a large workforce and was often expensive.
Castles served as offensive and defensive structures, as well as centers of administration and symbols of power.
They were strategically located near important features like mills and farmland.
Urban castles were used to control the local populace and protect travel routes.
Norman invaders established many castles in Tipperary, holding court to ensure obedience.
The introduction of gunpowder in the 14th century did not significantly impact castle construction until the 15th century when artillery became more powerful.
By the 16th century, castles were no longer desirable for habitation due to improved cannon fire, leading to the construction of artillery forts and country houses.
Notable castles in Tipperary include Nenagh Castle, Bridge Castle, Thurles, and Farney Castle.

Early castles were initially made of wood, but by the 10th century, people began constructing them out of stone with walls up to 30 feet thick.
Some castles had moats and drawbridges for added protection.
Castles were strategically built on high mountains, along rivers, lakes, hilltops, and near the sea to make them harder to attack.
Archers could shoot arrows through holes in the walls, and heavy iron doors made it difficult to breach the entrance.
Castles were dark and cold, but provided protection from enemies, making them desirable places to live for kings, lords, and noblemen.
Castles were important in a divided Europe, as they helped lords and kings defend their land and were centers of feasts and social gatherings.
However, by 1500 A.D., castles lost their significance as enemies began using cannons and kings relied on larger armies for protection.
This shift in warfare tactics made castles less secure, leading to their decline in importance.
Despite their eventual decline, castles played a crucial role in medieval society, serving as symbols of power and protection for the ruling class.

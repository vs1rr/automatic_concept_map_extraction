Castles have been built in various forms over the centuries, serving as private fortified residences for monarchs and nobleman.
The term "castle" is derived from the Latin word "castellum," meaning "fortified place."
Castles were initially constructed from earth and timber, later replaced by stone.
They served military, administrative, and domestic purposes, with aesthetics becoming increasingly important over time.
Castles were established by Norman invaders in England to secure their land and discourage rebellion.
As siege technology evolved, castles lost their military significance and were eventually replaced by country houses.
Most castles are found in Europe and the Middle East, dating back to the Middle Ages.
They controlled the surrounding area and served as symbols of power.
In some countries, a license to crenellate was required before building a castle to avoid seizure or deliberate damage.
Castle architecture evolved in response to changing siege technology, with some featuring concentric defense systems.
Elements of castle architecture, such as moats and machicolations, often served decorative as well as military purposes.
The introduction of gunpowder in the 14th century eventually led to the decline of true castles, replaced by artillery forts and country houses.
In the 18th century, there was a revival of interest in castles with the construction of mock castles for aesthetic purposes.

The text discusses the history and functions of castles in medieval England.
Castles were originally built by Norman invaders in 1066, serving both offensive and defensive military purposes.
They also functioned as social centers and symbols of power.
The first castles were made from earth and timber, but were later replaced by stone for increased defense.
Various improvements were made to castle defenses over time, such as arrow-slits, towers, and multiple walls.
The decline of castles can be attributed to the introduction of gunpowder, which made traditional castles vulnerable to artillery attacks.
Despite their diminished military role, castles continue to attract visitors as historical landmarks.

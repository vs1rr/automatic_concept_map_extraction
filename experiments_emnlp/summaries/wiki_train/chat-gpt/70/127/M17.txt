Medieval warfare during the Middle Ages was much more complex than the popular notion of knights charging across open fields.
Siegecraft played a significant role in warfare, with castle sieges being a common occurrence.
The construction of castles evolved over time, becoming powerful fortresses capable of defying intensive assaults.
Siegecraft involved a highly choreographed process that included assembling an army, gathering supplies, and employing various tactics to force a surrender.
The use of siege engines such as mangonels, ballistas, battering rams, and trebuchets was crucial in breaching castle defenses.
The siege tower, or belfry, was also used to bring attackers closer to the castle walls.
Negotiation, bribery, and intimidation were often employed to secure a surrender without open warfare.

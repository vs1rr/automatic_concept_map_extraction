The Empire of Brazil was established in 1822 after the declaration of independence from Portugal by Dom Pedro.
The First Reign (1822-1831) was marked by political instability, economic crisis, and conflicts with Portugal.
Dom Pedro I abdicated in favor of his son, Dom Pedro II, in 1831.
The Regency Period (1831-1840) saw a series of rebellions and political transitions until Dom Pedro II took power at the age of 14.
The Second Reign (1840-1889) was characterized by a decrease in conflicts, the dominance of the Conservative and Liberal parties, and the consolidation of the coffee industry.
The abolition of slavery was a gradual process that began with the Eusébio de Queirós law in 1850 and culminated in the Lei Áurea in 1888.
The empire also faced economic challenges, international pressure to end slavery, and dissatisfaction among the military and rural elites.
The monarchy ultimately fell in 1889 due to a combination of factors including economic crisis, military discontent, political centralization, and international influence.

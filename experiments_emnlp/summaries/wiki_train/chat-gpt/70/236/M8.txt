For 81 years, Brazil was part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves, and then became an independent Empire from 1822 to 1889.
The Portuguese court moved to Rio de Janeiro to escape Napoleon's troops, leading to Brazil's elevation from colony to kingdom.
When the king tried to return to Europe, Brazilians resisted reverting to colony status, prompting his son to declare independence.
The royal family, the Orleans-Braganza, ruled both nations to prevent a Republican revolution.
The Orleans-Braganza branch in Portugal is more royalist than in Brazil, but this may be changing.

Since the 16th century, Brazil had been under Portuguese rule, with King Dom João VI residing in the country since 1808.
In 1820, Portugal experienced a Constitutional Revolution, leading to the demand for the king's return.
Dom Pedro was left in charge of Brazil when his father returned to Portugal, but faced manipulation by Portuguese military officers.
The Cortes ordered Pedro to return to Europe and stripped him of power, leading to uprisings by the Bonificans and Liberals in Brazil.
Pedro gradually shifted his loyalties to Brazil, with the support of his wife Princess Leopoldina.
In January 1822, Pedro announced his decision to stay in Brazil for the nation's happiness.
He dismissed Avilez and appointed Jose Bonifácio as Minister of Kingdom and Foreign Affairs.
In September, Pedro declared independence from Portugal, proclaiming, "Independence or death!"
The official break from Portugal occurred on 22 September 1822, and on 12 October, Pedro was acclaimed as Dom Pedro I, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil.

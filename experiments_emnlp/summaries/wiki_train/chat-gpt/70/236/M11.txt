Brazil is a country located in South America, known for being the largest country in the subcontinent.
Before colonization, Brazil was inhabited by various Amerindian peoples, with the Portuguese being the first Europeans to explore the region in 1500.
The Portuguese established the first permanent settlement in 1532 and developed Brazil as a plantations colony, with sugar cane being the main crop.
Slaves were brought from Africa to work on the plantations.
In the 18th century, gold was discovered, leading to the exploration and colonization of the interior.


Brazil gained independence from Portugal in 1822, with Pedro I declaring himself emperor of the Empire of Brazil.
The empire was ruled as a constitutional parliamentary monarchy, with Pedro II taking over as emperor in 1843.
The empire saw political stability and economic growth, attracting immigrants from Europe.
In 1889, the military deposed the emperor and proclaimed the republic of Brazil.
The country's official name was changed to Federative Republic of Brazil in 1967.


Brazil has been involved in several wars related to nation-building in neighboring countries, including the Cisplatine War, Platine War, Uruguayan War, and the Triple Alliance War.
From 1889 to 1930, Brazil was ruled as a constitutional democracy, with only the oligarchy having access to power.
A civilian dictatorship was established in 1930, followed by a military dictatorship in 1964.
Democracy was restored in 1985, and Brazil has been governed by democratically elected presidents since then.

The population of Brazil is predominantly white, followed by mulatto and indigenous Amerindian peoples.

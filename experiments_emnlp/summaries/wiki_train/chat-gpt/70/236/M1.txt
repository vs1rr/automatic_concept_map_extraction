The Brazilian Empire was established on 7 September 1822 after declaring independence from Portugal, with Dom Pedro I as the first Emperor.
The empire was politically stable and had a powerful army, which was demonstrated in various wars and conflicts, including the Cisplatine War, the liberation of Bolivian Amazonas, and the War of the Triple Alliance.
Dom Pedro II succeeded his father as Emperor and oversaw a period of peace and stability, during which Brazil became an emerging international power.
The empire abolished slavery in 1888 and saw developments in visual arts, literature, and theater.
However, in 1889, a bloodless coup led to the Proclamation of the Republic, ending the Brazilian Empire.

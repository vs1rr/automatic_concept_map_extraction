In the nineteenth century, Brazil's history was heavily influenced by events in Europe, particularly Napoleon Bonaparte's conquest of the Iberian Peninsula.
When the Portuguese royal court fled to Rio de Janeiro in 1808, Dom João VI brought European-style institutions to the city.
Despite Napoleon's defeat, João did not want to return to Lisbon, preferring to stay in Brazil.
In 1821, he left his son, Prince Pedro, as regent in Brazil and returned to Europe.
Pedro's refusal to obey an order from Parliament in 1822 led to Brazil's independence from Portugal.
Father Belchior Pinheira de Oliveira's account of Pedro's declaration of independence highlights the prince's concerns and the support he received from his followers.
Pedro's coronation as Emperor Pedro I marked the establishment of the Empire of Brazil, with a focus on maintaining the existing socio-economic order.
Debret's paintings depict the separation of Brazil from Portugal and the ascension of Pedro I and Pedro II to power.
The differences in attire between King João VI and Emperor Pedro I reflect their political positions, while comparisons of Rio de Janeiro in Debret's works provide insights into the city's economy and social structure.
The arrival of Princess Leopoldine and Pedro II's assumption of leadership further illustrate the Brazilian monarchy's significance and the support it received from elites.
Pedro II's reign, studied in Roderick Barman's book "Citizen Emperor: Pedro II and the Making of Brazil, 1825-1891," was characterized by a complex personality and a long-lasting rule over Brazil.

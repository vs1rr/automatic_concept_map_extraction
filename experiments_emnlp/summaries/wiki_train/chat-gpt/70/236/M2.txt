The Napoleonic Wars had a significant impact on European monarchies, with many experiencing defeat at the hands of Napoleon's skilled forces.
Napoleon aimed to defeat Britain, a traditional foe, by implementing the Continental System to block British goods from entering European ports.
In response, Portugal refused to comply, leading to a French invasion in 1807.
The Portuguese royal family, led by Dom João VI, fled to Brazil, where they established a new capital in Rio de Janeiro.
Dom João's rule in Brazil led to significant cultural and economic reforms, but tensions arose between Brazil and Portugal, leading to calls for independence.
Dom Pedro, the crown prince, played a key role in declaring Brazilian independence in 1822, becoming the first emperor of Brazil.
The new Brazilian Empire was recognized by the United States, Portugal, and Great Britain, solidifying its sovereignty.
The transition from Portuguese colony to independent empire marked a significant transformation in Brazilian history.

Borobudur is a Buddhist stupa and temple complex in Central Java, Indonesia dating from the 8th century, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It is the largest Buddhist structure in the world and is set in the verdant Kedu Plain with active volcanoes in the backdrop.
The history of Borobudur is not definitively known, but it is believed to have been built in the 8th century during the Sailendra dynasty.
The construction took 75 years and was completed around 825 AD.
Borobudur and the nearby Hindu Prambanan temple complex were contemporaneous and were likely abandoned and hidden for centuries before being rediscovered by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1814.
The site was fully unearthed in 1885 and underwent restoration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
In 1968, a major restoration plan was initiated by UNESCO, and Borobudur was formally listed as a World Heritage Site in 1991.
The site has since become a major international tourist attraction, attracting over 3 million visitors annually.
Borobudur was affected by the 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi, but restoration efforts have been ongoing to preserve the monument.
Visitors should be respectful of the site's religious significance and follow guidelines to protect the integrity of the monument.
In addition to exploring Borobudur, visitors can also visit nearby temples and attractions in the Kedu Plain area.
Various accommodation options are available in the village of Borobudur, ranging from budget guesthouses to luxury resorts.
Nearby attractions include the Hindu temples of Prambanan, the cultural city of Yogyakarta, the Dieng Plateau, and the active volcano Mount Merapi.

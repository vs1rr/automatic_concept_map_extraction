The Borobudur Temple Compounds in Indonesia is a ninth-century Mahayana Buddhist monument that contains numerous Buddhist statues, including the Buddha Image Sitting in Open Chamber.
The temple represents Buddhist cosmology and consists of six square platforms with three circular platforms on top, adorned with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddhist statues.
The main dome at the center of the top platform is surrounded by 72 Buddhist statues.
The temple was abandoned due to the decline of Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms in Java and was hidden beneath volcanic ash until its rediscovery in 1814.
The Buddha statue in the chamber is depicted in a seated position with specific hand gestures known as mudra, symbolizing wisdom and method in the Buddhist faith.
The statue's placement before the top platform, representing the world of formlessness, conveys a message of enlightenment and liberation from worldly attachments to pilgrims.
The statue's condition is well-preserved, with some discoloration and possible erosion.
The Borobudur Temple Compounds served as a place of worship for Buddhists on pilgrimages, symbolizing the three stages of Buddhist cosmology.
The statue's symbolism and context provide insight into the importance of wisdom, method, and faith in achieving enlightenment in the Buddhist faith during the 8th and 9th centuries.

Indonesia is a country rich in natural attractions, including the famous Borobudur temple, a UNESCO world heritage site.
Built in the 8th century, this Buddhist temple is the second largest in the world after Angkor Wat in Cambodia.
The temple's structure is complex, with nine stacked platforms symbolizing different stages of human life according to Buddhist teachings.
Visitors can enjoy a stunning sunrise view from the top of the temple, with the morning sun rising behind the mountains.
On Vesak day, the birth of Buddha, visitors can witness rituals and the release of flying lanterns.
In addition to temple visits, visitors can watch traditional dance performances and even ride elephants around the temple.
Borobudur is easily accessible from the international airport in Jogjakarta, making it a convenient destination for travelers.

The reviewer describes their visit to Candi Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world, located on the island of Java.
They arrived at the temple before sunrise, climbing steep stairs in the dark with a torch provided by their guide.
The temple, built in the 9th century, consists of nine stacked platforms adorned with bas-relief panels and Buddha statues.
The structure is a blend of Mahayana Buddhist and traditional Indonesian art, with influences from Indian Gupta art.
The pilgrimage through the temple represents three levels of Buddhist spirituality, culminating in the central dome surrounded by Buddha statues.
The temple's history includes periods of abandonment, rediscovery, and damage from natural disasters and terrorist attacks.
Despite these challenges, Candi Borobudur remains a UNESCO World Heritage site and a place of pilgrimage for Buddhists in Indonesia.
The reviewer recommends visiting early in the morning to avoid the heat and crowds, and describes the experience of witnessing the sunrise at the temple as stunning and spiritually uplifting.
They also note the importance of preserving and protecting this remarkable cultural and historical site.

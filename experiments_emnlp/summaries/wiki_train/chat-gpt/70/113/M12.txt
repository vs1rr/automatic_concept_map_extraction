The text discusses two Indonesian World Heritage Sites: Borobudur Temple Compounds and Komodo National Park.
Borobudur Temple Compounds, built by the Syailendra Dynasty between 750 and 842 AD, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Central Java.
The site faces threats from development, tourism, and natural decay, but management efforts are in place to ensure its sustainability.
The site is promoted through branding, publications, and celebrity endorsements.
Komodo National Park, known for its endemic Komodo dragons, covers both land and marine areas in East Nusa Tenggara.
The park faces challenges such as depletion of prey species and destructive fishing practices.
Management efforts include a 25-year Management Master Plan and community-based tourism development.
The park is marketed through its unique wildlife and recognition as a World Heritage Site and New 7 Wonders of Nature.
Celebrity endorsements are also used for marketing.
Stakeholder collaboration and balancing preservation with commercialization are ongoing issues for both sites.

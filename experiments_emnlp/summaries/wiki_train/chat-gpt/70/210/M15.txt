The Roman province of Egypt, known as Aegyptus, was established in 30 BC under the reign of Augustus after his victory over Mark Anthony and Queen Cleopatra.
The capital of Egypt was Alexandria, and the province was named after an ancient Greek ruler named Aegyptus.
Gaius Cornelius Gallus was appointed as the first governor of Egypt, bringing an end to the political influence in the region.
The governor was in charge of the administration of justice and military security, with Roman law governing business matters.
Revenue was derived from Egypt through a complex tax system, with taxes levied on land and collected in cash.
The Romans divided Egypt into small provinces with town councils responsible for administration.
The social hierarchy introduced by the Romans placed Romans and Greeks at the top, followed by metropolites and villagers.
Citizenship could be obtained by joining the army or being part of the legions, with only Alexandrians allowed to have Roman citizenship.
Egypt was an essential source of food for the Romans, with goods exchanged for coins during trading activities in the 1st and 2nd centuries.
Christianity spread throughout Egypt, with Alexandria becoming a major center for the religion.
The Roman province also supported principles like Arianism, Gnosticism, Manichaeism, and Monasticism.
After the partition of the Roman Empire, Egypt became part of the Byzantine Empire with Constantinople as its new capital.
Despite this, Greek remained the popular language in Egypt, and Alexandria continued to be a religious and economic center as well as a main source of food supply for the Romans.

Ancient Egypt was a dominant civilization in the Mediterranean world for almost 30 centuries, from around 3100 B.C. to 332 B.C. Egyptology, the study of ancient Egypt, has been fueled by the discovery of monuments, objects, and artifacts covered in hieroglyphs.
The culture of ancient Egypt was known for its art, architecture, and religious traditions.


The Predynastic Period, from around 5000 to 3100 B.C., saw the gradual development of Egyptian civilization.
Neolithic communities in northeastern Africa transitioned from hunting to agriculture, laying the groundwork for advancements in arts, crafts, technology, politics, and religion.
Two separate kingdoms, the Red Land and the White Land, were established around 3400 B.C., with King Menes unifying the country in the first dynasty.


The Archaic Period (3100-2686 B.C.) saw the establishment of the capital at White Walls (later Memphis) and the development of the ideology of kingship.
The king was considered a godlike being, closely associated with the god Horus.
Agriculture, particularly wheat and barley farming, formed the economic base of the Egyptian state.


The Old Kingdom (2686-2181 B.C.) began with the third dynasty and saw the construction of the Step-Pyramid at Saqqara and the Great Pyramid at Giza.
The kingdom enjoyed peace, prosperity, and absolute power under the pharaohs, but the wealth was depleted over time, leading to the end of the Old Kingdom.


The First Intermediate Period (2181-2055 B.C.) was marked by civil war, famine, and disease, leading to the division of Egypt into two kingdoms.
The Theban prince Mentuhotep reunited Egypt in the 11th dynasty, beginning the Middle Kingdom (2055-1786 B.C.).
The 12th dynasty saw a flourishing Egypt, with aggressive foreign policy, colonization of Nubia, and pyramid-building.


The Second Intermediate Period (1786-1567 B.C.) saw the invasion of the Hyksos, who ruled Egypt alongside native Theban rulers.
The Thebans eventually drove out the Hyksos, leading to the New Kingdom (1567-1085 B.C.).
Under Ahmose I, Egypt was reunited, establishing a great empire and engaging in military campaigns.


The New Kingdom was notable for powerful kings like Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, and Amenhotep III, as well as royal women like Queen Hatshepsut.
Amenhotep IV, later known as Akhenaton, undertook a religious revolution, but the worship of multiple gods was restored after his death.
The Ramesside period saw the restoration of the Egyptian empire and impressive building projects.


The Third Intermediate Period (1085-664 B.C.) saw changes in Egyptian politics, society, and culture, with the rise of local officials and foreign rulers.
The Saite dynasty briefly ruled a reunified Egypt before falling to the Persians in 525 B.C. Egypt regained independence briefly under native rulers before falling to the Persians again in 343 B.C.
Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 B.C., leading to centuries of Roman rule and the eventual introduction of Christianity.


The conquest of Egypt by the Arabs in the seventh century A.D. marked the end of ancient Egyptian culture and the beginning of its modern incarnation.

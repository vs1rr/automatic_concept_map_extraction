The unification of Upper and Lower Egypt marked the beginning of ancient Egyptian history, with pharaohs ruling over a vast empire starting around 2686 BCE.
Prior to this unification, most Egyptians lived under the rule of either the northern Lower Egypt or the southern Upper Egypt.
Lower Egypt, known as the Black Land, was located at the end of the Nile River and was ruled by kings who wore a red crown and used a bee as their royal symbol.
Upper Egypt, known as the Red Land, was located near the origins of the Nile and was ruled by kings who wore a white crown and used a sedge as their symbol.
The unification of Egypt occurred when the king of Upper Egypt invaded and conquered Lower Egypt, leading to the formation of a single kingdom under a pharaoh.
The traditional date for this unification is 2686 BCE, although the exact year is debated.
The pharaohs of unified Egypt wore a double crown that combined the red and white crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt.
Religious traditions also mixed, with the people of unified Egypt worshipping the pharaoh as an incarnation of the hawk-god Horus.
This unification marked the true beginning of ancient Egyptian culture and history, with the blending of traditions from both kingdoms shaping the identity of the new empire.

Ancient Egypt, spanning the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, has had a profound influence on Western traditions in art, architecture, and religion.
The Old Kingdom, beginning in 2700 B.C., saw the construction of the Step Pyramid by Pharaoh Zoser, marking a shift towards pyramid building for the afterlife.
The religion of the time focused on creation and gods, with a decline in the power of the pharaohs due to the rise of the priesthood.
The decline of the Old Kingdom was attributed to internal factors such as royal marriages and depletion of the treasury.


The Middle Kingdom, from 2050 B.C. to 1800 B.C., saw a revival of pyramid building and the rise of the god Osiris in religion.
The myth of Osiris, similar to Christian beliefs, emphasized resurrection and justice.
Art flourished during this time, with intricate jewelry and literary masterpieces.
The Middle Kingdom ended with the invasion of the Hyksos.


The New Kingdom, from 1465 B.C. to 1165 B.C., saw a resurgence of power under the eighteenth dynasty, with the Valley of the Kings replacing pyramids as burial grounds.
The religion shifted towards the worship of Amun-Re, with Pharaoh Amenhotep IV introducing monotheism through the god Aton.
This new religion, along with the art form of naturalism, did not last long as internal struggles led to the return of old beliefs.


Despite the eventual decline and conquest of Egypt, the legacy of ancient Egypt lives on in Western culture, influencing art, architecture, and religion, including Christianity.
Ancient Egypt's longevity and stability make it a remarkable and notable society that continues to impact modern traditions.

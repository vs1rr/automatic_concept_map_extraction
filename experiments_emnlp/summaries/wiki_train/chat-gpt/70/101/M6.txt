The final tower at the World Trade Center in New York, 2 World Trade Center, has been designed by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels.
The 80-storey building will be the third tallest in Manhattan at 1,330ft and is set to open in 2020.
The design features seven separate boxes stacked on top of each other, creating a vertical village appearance.
The building will have outdoor gardens on the upper floors of each block.
Companies like News Corp and 21st Century Fox have signed tentative leases for offices in the building.
The tower is meant to blend in with both the Tribeca neighborhood and the World Trade Center complex.
Construction on the main building, One World Trade Center, began in 2006 and was opened in 2014.
Seven World Trade Center was completed in 2006, number four opened in 2013, and Three World Trade Center is scheduled to open in 2017.
The design of 2 World Trade Center aims to bring together diversity and unity, with a unique and modern architectural style

The collapse of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, led to a thorough investigation by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to determine the causes and implications of the disaster.
Despite the challenges of limited evidence due to the destruction of the buildings, the NIST team gathered all available data to reconstruct the events leading up to the collapse.
Through extensive analysis, simulations, and testing, they were able to determine that the impacts of the aircraft, combined with the fires, led to the collapse of the towers.
The investigation also revealed vulnerabilities in the buildings' design and safety systems, such as the dislodging of fireproofing insulation and the failure of sprinklers.


The collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 (WTC 7), which was not hit by an aircraft, raised further questions about building safety and emergency responses.
NIST's investigation into the collapse of WTC 7 concluded that uncontrolled fires caused structural weaknesses, leading to a progressive collapse.
This was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily due to fires.
In response to these disasters, NIST issued 31 recommendations to improve the safety of high-rises and emergency responses in the face of major threats.


While some critics raised concerns about the costs and benefits of implementing these recommendations, NIST defended its investigation and the resulting recommendations.
The agency made efforts to involve the public and engineering community in the review process, but some disagreements persisted regarding the conclusions of the investigation.
Despite these challenges, NIST's recommendations have led to significant changes in international building codes, aimed at improving building safety and emergency preparedness.


The changes include requirements for additional exit stairwells or specially designed elevators in tall buildings, glow-in-the-dark markings in stairwells, and more effective fire-resistive materials.
These changes have been adopted in the International Codes Council and by state and local authorities, with New York City and other projects in the United States already implementing them.
The revisions to building codes have broad implications for building safety and have been described as remarkable in their speed, magnitude, and scope.


Overall, the forensic investigation of the Twin Towers collapse has not only provided answers to long-standing questions about the events of September 11, 2001, but has also led to significant improvements in building codes and safety standards.
The lessons learned from this tragedy have been instrumental in preventing future disasters and ensuring the safety of high-rise buildings and their occupants.

On September 11, 2001, there was foreknowledge of the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7, with two major television networks even making premature announcements of the collapse.
The official accounts, Account 1 and Account 2, provide differing explanations for the collapse.
Account 1 suggests that WTC 7 was critically damaged by debris from the collapsing WTC 1, causing fires and structural damage, while Account 2 claims that the collapse was primarily due to fire and a unique sequence of events inside the building.
However, neither account aligns with the evidence, as witnesses were certain of the collapse and some had this foreknowledge hours in advance.
The premature announcements of the collapse by CNN and the BBC further contradict the official accounts.
This foreknowledge suggests that WTC 7 was brought down through controlled demolition, supporting previous conclusions about the collapse.

Building 7, a 47-story skyscraper in the World Trade Center complex, collapsed at 5:21:10 pm on September 11, 2001.
Despite not being hit by an airplane, it suffered minimal damage compared to other buildings nearby.
The collapse of Building 7 raised questions as it would have been the first fire-induced collapse of a steel-frame high-rise.
The 9/11 Commission Report did not mention Building 7, and a significant portion of Americans were unaware of its collapse.
It took the federal government seven years to investigate and issue a report on Building 7.
Over 1,700 architects and engineers have called for a new investigation, including a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives.
Witnesses reported discussions about demolishing the building at the scene, and it housed various intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
Building 7 also housed the NYC Office of Emergency Management's Emergency Operations Center, known as "Giuliani's Bunker."

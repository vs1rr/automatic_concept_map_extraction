The Pendle Witch trials began on August 18, 1612, with nine Lancashire women and two men accused of various murders.
Twelve people were charged, with one found not guilty and another dying in prison before trial.
The remaining ten were found guilty and executed by hanging.
The trials are well-documented in British history, thanks to Thomas Potts' published account, "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster."
Many of the defendants identified as witches or village healers who practiced "magic" for payment.
Some even admitted to practicing witchcraft in the Pendle Hill area for years.
The trials were significant for their scale, as only around 500 people were executed for witchcraft during the 300-year period they were carried out.
The ten found guilty in Pendle represented 2% of all British witches to face trial during that time.
Despite popular belief, witch trials were not as common as thought in the early modern period.

The Pendle witches were a group of twelve people accused of witchcraft in the 17th century, with one dying in custody and eleven going to trial.
The trials took place in Lancaster, with only one person being found not guilty.
The events were well-documented in an official publication by Thomas Potts, leading to the story becoming a well-known legend.
The background to the trials involved two rival families, the Demdike and Chattox families, who were known for practicing magic and dealing in herbs and medicines.
The fear and fascination with witchcraft during this time, fueled by King James I's interest in the subject, contributed to the unrest and accusations of witchcraft in the region.
The trials were a result of a series of events, including an altercation between Alizon Device and a pedlar, John Law, which led to accusations against the two families.
The trials were held in August 1612, with some of the accused genuinely believing in their guilt while others fought to clear their names.
The extent of the witch trials in Lancashire was exceptional compared to other regions, possibly due to the potential financial gain from claiming powers in witchcraft.
Overall, the Pendle witch trials were a result of a combination of factors, including social unrest, fear of witchcraft, and personal rivalries, making it one of the most notorious witch trials in history.

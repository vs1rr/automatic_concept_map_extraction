A statue of Alice Nutter, one of the Pendle witches accused of murder by witchcraft in 1612, will be placed in Roughlee to commemorate the 400th anniversary of her death.
The statue will be located on Blacko Bar Road on land donated by a descendant of Nutter.
The parish council has set guidelines for the design, emphasizing the need to celebrate Nutter as a resident unfairly treated and to represent the year 1612.
The statue must also include a seating area for visitors.
Nutter was perceived as different from the other accused witches due to her wealth and lack of defense during her trial.
She was found guilty and executed at Lancaster Castle in 1612.
The statue is expected to be completed by April 2012.
The council hopes the statue will raise awareness of the true story of the Pendle witches and provide a chance to move on from Nutter's image as a witch.
The Pendle Trials were famous in English history, and Nutter's case was unique due to her background and lack of defense.
The statue aims to honor Nutter's memory and shed light on the injustices faced by her and the other accused witches.

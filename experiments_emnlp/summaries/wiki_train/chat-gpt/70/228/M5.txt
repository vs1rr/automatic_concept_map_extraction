In the early 19th century, Mexico's migration policy for Texas was similar to that for California and New Mexico.
A US citizen from Arkansas, Moses Austin, had acquired land in Texas in 1820, which was confirmed by Mexico in 1823.
Austin's son, Stephen F. Austin, began selling plots of land to settlers, attracting people from various states with the promise of fertile land for farming at a low cost.
However, Mexico imposed restrictions on land ownership by foreigners, leading to tensions with the Anglo settlers in Texas.


In 1828, President Andrew Jackson offered to buy Texas from Mexico, but the offer was rejected.
Meanwhile, Mexico's elite and poor populations had different views on settling in Texas, with the elite showing no interest in farming and the poor feeling they had no opportunity to succeed as farmers.
Mexico attempted to encourage Mexican and European migrants to settle in Texas, which angered the Anglo settlers who were concerned about preserving their culture and political rights, including the issue of slavery.


Political turmoil in Mexico led to President Bustamante's unpopularity and an uprising led by Santa Anna in 1832.
Santa Anna, seen as a liberal by the Anglos in Texas, won the presidency in a landslide victory.
However, he left the duties of the presidency to Vice President Gómez Farías and focused on his personal interests.
Santa Anna's actions against the conservative forces, including the army and the Church, led to further unrest in Texas.


In 1833, a convention in Texas called for reforms in Mexico, including the repeal of anti-immigration laws and the establishment of Texas as an independent state within Mexico.
However, Santa Anna's dictatorship and the repeal of the constitution of 1824 led to increased tensions.
In 1835, fighting broke out between Anglo settlers and Mexican troops, leading to the Battle of the Alamo in which the Anglos were defeated by Santa Anna's forces.


Santa Anna's victory at the Alamo led him to believe he had defeated the Anglos in Texas, but the Anglos continued to resist.
In April 1836, Sam Houston's forces defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, capturing Santa Anna and forcing him to sign a pledge to end the fighting and withdraw Mexican troops from Texas.
Texas declared independence in March 1836, and the United States officially recognized Texas as an independent nation in 1837.


Despite Mexico's refusal to recognize Texas' independence, other countries such as France, Great Britain, Holland, and Belgium established trade agreements with Texas and recognized its independence.
Santa Anna's attempts to sell Texas to the United States were unsuccessful, and he was eventually sent back to Mexico.
The Gadsden Purchase in 1853 further solidified the border between Mexico and the United States, marking the end of the conflict over Texas and the territories in the region.

The State of Coahuila y Tejas, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, was formed under the Mexican Constitution of 1824, which was influenced by the United States Constitution and the Spanish Constitution of 1812.
The new state legislature in Saltillo published a state constitution in 1827, which separated executive, legislative, and judicial authority.
The state constitution contained elements from the Spanish tradition, including the establishment of Catholicism as the state religion and the community property system.
The homestead protection against bankruptcy was also established to stabilize frontier families.
The Constitution of Coahuila y
Tejas also instructed the Legislature to promote education.
However, discontent with misgovernment in Texas and political unrest in Mexico led to a new convention in 1833 that drew up a constitution for Texas as a state independent from Coahuila.
Stephen F. Austin's delivery of this constitution to Mexico City led to his imprisonment, marking a key milestone in the growing tensions between Texas and the Mexican government.

San Felipe de Austin was founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin as the unofficial capital of his colony.
It quickly became the first urban center in the Austin colony, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Old San Antonio Road and from the Lavaca River to the San Jacinto River.
The town was strategically located on a high bluff overlooking fertile bottomlands, offering advantages such as fresh water sources and a central location.
By 1828, the population had grown to about 200, with various businesses and amenities established.


San Felipe de Austin served as the social, economic, and political center of the Austin colony, with a diverse population of Hispanic, American, and European origin.
The town was home to the colonial land office and played a key role in the operation of the Texas postal service.
Several significant figures in early Texas history resided in or visited San Felipe de Austin, and the town became a trading center for cotton plantations in the surrounding area.


As the capital of the colony, San Felipe de Austin played a crucial role in the events leading up to the Texas Revolution.
Conventions were held in the town, and it served as the capital of the provisional government during the Consultation of November 1835.
After the fall of the Alamo, the town was evacuated and burned to prevent it from falling into Mexican hands.
The residents fled during the Runaway Scrape but began to return after the Texan victory at the Battle of San Jacinto.


Despite efforts to rebuild, San Felipe de Austin never fully recovered its former stature.
It was incorporated in 1837 and became the county seat of Austin County, but administrative functions were eventually moved to Bellville in 1846.
By the mid-1840s, the town had only a few remaining buildings.
In 1940, most of the original townsite property was donated to the state.


The town's history is marked by significant events such as the burning during the Runaway Scrape, the presence of notable figures like Stephen F. Austin and William Barrett Travis, and the establishment of the commemorative site in 1928.
San Felipe de Austin also saw military engagements during the Texas Revolution, including the brief battle across the Brazos River in which John Bricker became the only Texian casualty.


Overall, San Felipe de Austin played a crucial role in the early history of Texas, serving as a key center of commerce, government, and culture in the Austin colony.
Its legacy is preserved through historical sites, annual celebrations, and the memory of the events that shaped the town during the tumultuous period of the Texas Revolution.

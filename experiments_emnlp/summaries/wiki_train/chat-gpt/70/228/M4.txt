The Convention of 1833 took place in San Felipe as a follow-up to the Convention of 1832, which San Antonio had refused to send delegates to.
Approximately fifty-six delegates attended, including Sam Houston.
The convention petitioned for the repeal of the anti-immigration section of the Law of April 6, 1830, and proposed splitting Coahuila and Texas.
A committee, led by Houston, prepared a constitution modeled after the Massachusetts constitution of 1780, which included provisions for trial by jury, habeas corpus, freedom of the press, and universal suffrage.
David G. Burnet headed a committee to prepare a memorial to the Mexican government, and Juan Erasmo Segu√≠n, Dr. James B. Miller, and Stephen F. Austin were chosen to present the petitions.
Austin ultimately went to Mexico alone.
The convention adjourned on April 13.
The event is documented in various historical sources, including Stephen F. Austin's writings, Eugene C. Barker's biography of Austin, and the Austin Papers.
Other sources include Holland Edwards Bell's thesis on the Texas Convention of 1832, John Henry Brown's history of Texas, E. W. Winkler's research on the membership of the 1833 Convention, and Henderson K. Yoakum's comprehensive history of Texas.

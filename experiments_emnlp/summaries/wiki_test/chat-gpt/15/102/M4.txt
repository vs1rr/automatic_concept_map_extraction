Antiochus IV Epiphanes was a Seleucid king known for his promotion of Greek culture and institutions, as well as his attempts to suppress Judaism which led to the Wars of the Maccabees.
He ruled from 175 to 164 BC and was the son of Antiochus III the Great.
Antiochus had a complex relationship with Rome, paying war indemnities and later invading Egypt.
He also made efforts to strengthen his kingdom by founding and fostering Greek cities, which brought him into conflict with the Jews.
Antiochus' policies led to the revolt of Judas Maccabeus, who successfully reconsecrated the Temple in Jerusalem.
Antiochus died in 164 BC in Tabae, Iran, after campaigning against the Parthians.
His death was seen by some as a punishment for attempting to loot a shrine in Elam.
Despite his efforts to hellenize his kingdom, Antiochus' reign was marked by conflict and ultimately ended with his death in Persis.

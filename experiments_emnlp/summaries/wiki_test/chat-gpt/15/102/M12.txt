The location of the First Temple has been a topic of debate, with various theories and evidence pointing to different locations.
The Book of Genesis mentions the Mountain of Yahweh in the land of Moriah as the site of the near-sacrifice of Isaac, with the Samaritans identifying it as Gerizim and the post-exilic writer of Chronicles placing it in Jerusalem.
The hill where the temple was eventually built was the only inhabited area in Jerusalem for the first eight centuries, with the outcropping of bedrock that now gives the Dome of the Rock its name possibly exerting a numinous power.
The pre-Israelite inhabitants of Jerusalem may have worshipped a sun-god on this hill, with Solomon's temple possibly perpetuating this tradition.
David's purchase of the threshing floor of Arauna the Jebusite and the subsequent building of an altar there also suggest a religious significance to the area.
The layout of Solomon's palace and temple, as described in 1 Kings, indicates that the temple faced east and was smaller than the palace.
The area beneath Herod's temple platform, which is now under the control of the Muslim Supreme Council, has not yielded much evidence from the First Temple period due to extensive rebuilding and exploitation of the area over the centuries.
The strategic location of the hill where the temple was built, near valleys that provided natural defenses, suggests that it may have been chosen for its fortification potential.
Leen Ritmeyer's reconstruction of the ancient platform near the Dome of the Rock, based on archaeological evidence and biblical descriptions, suggests that it may have been the site of the First Temple.
The Holy of Holies, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, may have been located where the Dome of the Rock now stands, with the rock itself possibly being the place of the ark.
Excavations in the Ophel area have uncovered some artifacts from the First Temple period, including a black juglet dating back to the 10th century BC, as well as sections of walls that may have belonged to Solomon's temple.
The scarcity of remains from before the 8th century BC in the Ophel area may be due to extensive building activity and later destruction of earlier structures.
Despite the lack of definitive evidence, the biblical account and archaeological findings suggest that the First Temple may have been located near the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.

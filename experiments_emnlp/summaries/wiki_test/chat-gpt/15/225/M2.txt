The Chalukya Dynasty ruled over Southern and Central India from the 6th to 12th centuries, with three different empires under the same name.
The Badami Chalukyas, the oldest of the three, saw prominence under King Pulakesi II.
The dynasty's rule brought a golden age of trade, commerce, and architecture, with Kannada and Telugu literature flourishing.
Chalukya architecture was a fusion of Northern and Southern styles.
Inscriptions and foreign travelers' accounts provide insight into the dynasty's origins and history.
The Badami Chalukyas eventually fell to the Rashtrakutas, but the Western Chalukyas revived the empire in 973 CE.

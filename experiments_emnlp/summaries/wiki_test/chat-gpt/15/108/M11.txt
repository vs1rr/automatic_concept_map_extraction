Belton House in Lincolnshire, built in the late 17th century, is a prime example of the perfect English Country House.
The house was restored to its original appearance in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.
Belton remained in the Brownlow-Cust family for three hundred years before being given to the National Trust in 1985.

Belton House in Lincolnshire, England was built between 1685 and 1688 for Sir John Brownlow.
The house is an example of the Carolean style and features a "double pile" plan with a central saloon.
The property includes formal gardens, a park with avenues and a lake, and was in the Brownlow family for over 300 years.
Financial difficulties led to the transfer of ownership to the National Trust in 1984.

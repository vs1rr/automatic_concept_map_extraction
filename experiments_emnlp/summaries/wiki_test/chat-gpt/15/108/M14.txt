Belton House has become a popular film location, featured in adaptations of Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice.
The house, built in the late 17th century, was used for exterior shots in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.
The north front of the house is where characters like Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Collins approach Lady Catherine's residence, Rosings.
The Dutch garden on the north front has undergone changes since filming.
The west front is where Mr. Darcy retreats after his rejected proposal to Elizabeth.
The east front features scenes of Elizabeth wandering the grounds and receiving Darcy's letter.
The Belmount Tower, built in the 18th century, was used as a vantage point for the Belton estate.
The tower was visited by Jane Austen's distant relative, Caroline Lybbe Powys.
The Belton grounds, including the deer park and Italian Sunken Garden, were not used in the adaptation but are worth visiting.
The interiors of the house and the parish church of Belton village were also featured in the adaptation.

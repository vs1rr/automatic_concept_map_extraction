A row has erupted over missing artefacts from the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum in Bristol, which has now closed.
Trustees are in talks with owners about compensation for items that may have been sold without permission.
Among the missing items is a 19th-century maritime painting belonging to Lord Caldecote, which was sold at auction.
Police have investigated the loss of objects but no arrests have been made.
An investigation by BBC's Inside Out West program claims that 144 objects belonging to eight lenders remain missing.
The former director of the museum, Gareth Griffiths, is in dispute with the board of trustees over the missing artefacts.

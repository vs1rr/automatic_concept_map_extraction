In 1936, King Edward VIII of Britain announced his intention to marry his mistress, Wallis Simpson, leading to a constitutional crisis.
Despite his attempts to find a compromise, the government and public were against the marriage due to Wallis's unsuitability as queen consort.
Edward ultimately abdicated the throne in December 1936, allowing his brother Albert to become King George VI.
Edward and Wallis married the following year and lived a controversial life, with ties to the Nazi regime.
The abdication paved the way for George VI, who provided stability during World War II.
Sites related to the crisis include Fort Belvedere and Frogmore Mausoleum.
Films and books have been made about the abdication, offering further insight into this significant event in British history.

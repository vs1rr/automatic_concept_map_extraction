Edward VIII met Wallis Simpson in 1931 and fell deeply in love with her, ultimately leading to his abdication in December 1936.
Despite attempts to find a compromise, including a morganatic marriage proposal, the British government and Dominions rejected the idea.
Edward decided to abdicate and signed the Instrument of Abdication on December 10, 1936.
His brother, George VI, succeeded him as King.
Edward and Wallis Simpson married in France in June 1937, with her divorce becoming final in May of that year.
The abdication was endorsed by Parliament, and Edward left England for Austria.
George VI was crowned King, and Wallis became the Duchess of Windsor.
The couple remained together until Edward's death in 1972.

The Abdication Crisis of 1936 involved King Edward VIII's decision to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American socialite, which was met with outrage by the British public and government officials due to the Church of England's stance on divorce.
Despite warnings and advice from his advisers, Edward VIII continued to pursue the marriage, leading to a constitutional crisis.
Ultimately, Edward VIII chose to abdicate the throne on December 10th, 1936, in favor of his brother, Albert, who became King George VI.
The abdication brought stability and continuity to the British government during a time of rising tensions in Europe, with George VI's reign symbolizing a return to traditional values.

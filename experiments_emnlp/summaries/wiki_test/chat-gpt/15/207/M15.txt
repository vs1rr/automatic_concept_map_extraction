Bobby Sands and nine other republican prisoners died on hunger strike in Long Kesh 25 years ago.
Melanie Mc Fadyean finds seven survivors and asks if it was worth it.
The survivors reflect on the legacy of the hunger strikes, which paved the way for the republican movement's shift from militarism to electoral politics and peace.
The hunger strikes were a response to the British government's decision to revoke special category status for IRA prisoners in 1976.
The prisoners engaged in protests, including the blanket and dirty protests, to demand their rights.
The first hunger strike in 1980 ended without concessions from the government, leading to a second hunger strike in 1981.
Bobby Sands, the leader of the hunger strike, won a by-election before his death, which galvanized support for the prisoners' cause.
The survivors endured physical and psychological hardships during the hunger strike, but ultimately, they believe their sacrifices were worth it.
They have moved on with their lives, some working in community and education programs, while others still hold on to the ideals of a united Ireland.
The hunger strike remains a defining moment in the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

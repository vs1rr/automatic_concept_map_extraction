The blanket protest at the Maze prison in Northern Ireland was part of a five-year protest by IRA and INLA prisoners against the removal of their Special Category Status in 1976.
This status had allowed them to be treated as political prisoners rather than ordinary criminals.
The protest began when newly convicted prisoner Kieran Nugent refused to wear a prison uniform and was given a blanket.
Other prisoners joined the protest, leading to a dirty protest and eventually a hunger strike in 1980.
The hunger strike aimed to secure the "Five Demands" for political status, but ultimately ended without full concessions from the government.
The 1981 Irish hunger strike, led by Bobby Sands, resulted in the deaths of ten prisoners.
Following the hunger strike, changes were made to prison policy, allowing paramilitary prisoners to wear their own clothes at all times.
The protest highlighted the tensions between the prisoners and prison officers, as well as the prisoners' determination to maintain their political status.

Bobby Sands, a leader of the Long Kesh hunger strikers, died 34 years ago at the age of 27.
Sands, a Catholic from Belfast, protested the removal of "political prisoner" status for IRA prisoners.
Despite intimidation and threats throughout his life, Sands remained committed to the Republican movement.
He was arrested multiple times and eventually sentenced to 14 years in prison.
Sands led a hunger strike in 1981, demanding better conditions for prisoners, but ultimately lost his life after 66 days.
His death, along with nine others, sparked outrage and led to increased support for Sinn FÃ©in.
Margaret Thatcher's refusal to negotiate on "Special Category Status" further fueled Republican sentiment.
Sands' election victory while on hunger strike was seen as a propaganda win for the movement.
The hunger strikes, despite their initial failure, became a symbol of resistance and martyrdom within the Republican movement.

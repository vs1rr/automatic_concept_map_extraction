The Far Eastern Party was a sledging component of the 1911â€“14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by Douglas Mawson.
The party aimed to explore the area far to the east of their main base in AdÃ©lie Land, pushing about 500 miles towards Victoria Land.
Accompanying Mawson were Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis and Xavier Mertz, using sledge dogs to increase their speed across the ice.
Initially making good progress, they crossed two huge glaciers on their route south-east.
However, on 14 December 1912, Ninnis and the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a crevasse and were lost.
With their supplies compromised, Mawson and Mertz turned back west, using the remaining sledge dogs to supplement their rations.
Mertz became sick and died, leaving Mawson to continue alone.
After almost a month of pulling his sledge across the Antarctic, Mawson reached Aladdin's Cave on 1 February 1913, only to be trapped there by a blizzard.
He missed the ship back to Australia, but eventually returned with a relief party in December 1913.
The causes of Mertz's death and Mawson's related illness remain uncertain, with theories including hypervitaminosis A from eating the livers of their Greenland Huskies.
Sir Edmund Hillary described Mawson's journey as "probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration".

Spencer Perceval was a British Prime Minister born in 1762, known for his religious beliefs, opposition to radicalism, and prosecution of political radicals.
He served in various legal and political roles before becoming Prime Minister in 1809.
Perceval's ministry faced challenges, including the Walcheren expedition and the costs of war against Napoleon.
Despite gathering support, his political conservatism and lack of ambition limited his lasting impact on British politics.
Perceval was assassinated in 1812 by John Bellingham, who felt wronged by the government.
Perceval is the only British Prime Minister to be assassinated while in office, and he received a monument in Westminster Abbey

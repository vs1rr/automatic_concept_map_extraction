The text discusses the assassination of President William McKinley on September 6, 1901, by anarchist Leon Czolgosz at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.
McKinley, a popular and kind-hearted president, was shot twice by Czolgosz, with the second bullet causing a fatal infection.
Despite initial hope for his recovery, McKinley died on September 14, 1901.
The nation was shocked and mourned the loss of their president, much like the reaction to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
The text highlights McKinley's compassion and thoughtfulness towards others, as well as the missed opportunity to save him with an X-Ray machine at the exposition.
Czolgosz was quickly executed for the assassination, and the nation came together in grief and unity.
The text draws parallels between the events of 1901 and 2001, emphasizing how acts of terror can shatter innocence and unity, leading to new challenges and battles for the country.

also annexed by the United States during Mc Kinley's presidency.

[165]Economic policies and the Gold Standard Act Mc Kinley's presidency was marked by a period of rapid economic growth and prosperity.

[166] The Dingley Tariff, passed in 1897, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry and protect factory workers from foreign competition.

[167] The tariff was highly controversial, with critics arguing that it would harm consumers by raising prices on imported goods.

[168] However, Mc Kinley believed that high tariffs would restore prosperity to the nation.

[169] In 1900, Mc Kinley secured the passage of the Gold Standard Act, which officially placed the United States on the gold standard, ensuring that the dollar would be backed by gold reserves.

[170] This move was intended to stabilize the economy and prevent inflation.

[171]Mc Kinley's economic policies were largely successful, leading to a period of rapid economic growth and industrial expansion.

[172] The United States experienced a boom in manufacturing and industry, with new factories opening and production increasing.

[173]
The country also saw a rise in wages and living standards for many Americans.

[174] Mc Kinley's policies were popular with business leaders and industrialists, who saw their profits increase as a result of the protective tariffs and stable currency.

[175]Foreign policy and the Spanish-American War Mc Kinley's foreign policy was focused on expanding American influence and protecting American interests abroad.

[176] He hoped to avoid conflict with other nations, but was willing to use military force when necessary to achieve American goals.

[177] Mc Kinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War of 1898, a conflict that resulted in the United States acquiring territories in the Caribbean and Pacific.

[178] The war was a quick and decisive victory for the United States, with American forces defeating the Spanish navy and army in a series of battles.

[179]
As part of the peace settlement, Spain ceded control of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States, and the independent Republic of Hawaii was also annexed as a U.S. territory.

[180]Historians regard Mc Kinley's victory in the 1896 election as a realigning election, marking the beginning of the Republican-dominated Fourth Party System.

[181]
Mc Kinley's presidency is generally considered above average, with his economic policies and foreign interventions being seen as successful.

[182] However, his universally positive public perception was soon overshadowed by his successor, Theodore Roosevelt, who became a larger-than-life figure in American politics.

[183]Assassination and legacy On September 6, 1901, Mc Kinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.

[184] Mc Kinley died eight days later on September 14, 1901, from his injuries.

[185] He was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt, who went on to become one of the most popular and influential presidents in American history.

[186]

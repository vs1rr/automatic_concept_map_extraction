Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, assassinated President William McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York on September 6, 1901.
McKinley, a popular president known for his policies on protectionism and reciprocity, was shot twice by Czolgosz while greeting visitors at the Temple of Music.
Despite initial optimism about his recovery, McKinley died on September 14 from gangrene caused by the bullet wounds.
Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in as president following McKinley's death.
Czolgosz, who confessed to the crime, was quickly tried, found guilty, and executed in October 1901.
The assassination led to increased security measures for future presidents, with the Secret Service taking on the responsibility of presidential protection.

Leon Frank Czolgosz was an anarchist who assassinated U.S. President William McKinley on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York.
Czolgosz was influenced by anarchist writers such as Emma Goldman and was inspired by the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy.
He purchased a revolver and shot McKinley twice at point-blank range during a public reception.
McKinley initially appeared to be recovering but died on September 14.
Czolgosz was quickly convicted and sentenced to death, and he was executed by electrocution on October 29, 1901.
The assassination led to increased security measures for U.S. presidents, with the Secret Service eventually being officially designated as the agency responsible for presidential protection.
The Temple of Music, where the assassination took place, was torn down, and a monument was erected in Buffalo to honor McKinley.
Theodore Roosevelt succeeded McKinley as President.
Emma Goldman faced negative publicity for her comments on the assassination, and Czolgosz's story has been depicted in various forms of media.

On September 6, 1901, U.S. President William McKinley was assassinated by anarchist Leon Czolgosz at the Pan-American Exposition in New York.
McKinley initially appeared to be recovering from the shooting, but he ultimately died on September 14 from gangrene.
The assassination took place as McKinley was greeting the public at the Exposition, with Czolgosz concealing a revolver in his handkerchief and shooting the President twice.
Despite efforts to save him, McKinley's condition worsened, leading to his death.
Czolgosz was quickly arrested, admitted to the crime, and was sentenced to death.
McKinley's death led to Vice President Theodore Roosevelt being sworn in as President of the United States.
The assassination shocked the nation and highlighted the dangers faced by public figures.

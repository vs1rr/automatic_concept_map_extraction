The history of federal Indian law in the Supreme Court is complex and has evolved over time.
The guiding principles in Indian law include Congress having plenary power in Indian affairs, the duty of protection owed to Indian nations, the retention of inherent sovereign powers by Indian nations, the absence of state law in Indian country without congressional authorization, and the requirement for Congress to clearly state its intention to divest tribal sovereignty.
The Supreme Court has played a significant role in modernizing federal Indian law, particularly during the Warren and Burger Court eras.
However, despite congressional support for tribal self-governance since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has at times resisted federal Indian policy, undermining tribal governance.


The history of Indian law in the Supreme Court began with the Marshall Trilogy, which established federal primacy in Indian affairs, excluded state law from Indian country, and recognized tribal governance authority.
The Court's decisions in cases such as Johnson v. M'Intosh, Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, and Worcester v. Georgia set the stage for the relationship between Indian nations and the American dual sovereign structure.
The Court's decisions in the 19th century, including the plenary power trilogy, led to the wholesale removal of Indian nations, warfare, and exploitation of Indian lands and resources.


In the modern era, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed tribal sovereignty and self-governance in cases such as Williams v. Lee and has recognized tribal authority over taxation, prosecution, and civil claims.
However, in recent decades, the Court has shifted towards skepticism of tribal interests and has ruled against tribal claims in cases involving taxation, jurisdiction, and tribal immunity.
Despite these challenges, tribal interests have prevailed in cases involving statutes, treaties, and self-determination.


Overall, tribal interests have faced obstacles in the Supreme Court, but Indian people and their governments have become more integrated into the American constitutional structure.
The future of federal Indian law is promising, despite the ongoing challenges faced by Indian nations in the courts.

The Supreme Court has played a significant role in shaping the doctrine of American Indian tribal sovereignty from the time of Chief Justice John Marshall to Justice Thurgood Marshall.
Tribal sovereignty is a crucial aspect of the military, social, and economic development of the United States.
The Court has interpreted the powers of Congress and the President in relation to tribal sovereignty, with Congress having the power to regulate commerce with Indian tribes and the President having the ability to enter into treaties with them.


The Court has grappled with two competing theories of tribal sovereignty: one that tribes have inherent powers of sovereignty predating the discovery of America, and another that tribes only have sovereignty as granted by Congress.
Over the years, the Court has favored one theory or the other in deciding cases, impacting the powers and protections afforded to tribes against federal and state government encroachment.


The Marshall trilogy of cases established the basis for interpreting federal Indian law and defining tribal sovereignty.
These cases limited the complete sovereignty of Indian tribes, establishing them as "domestic dependent nations" subject to the trust relationship with the United States.
The Court's decisions in subsequent cases, such as Ex Parte Crow Dog and Worcester v. Georgia, further shaped the balance of power between the federal government, states, and tribes.


However, in more recent cases like Mc Clanahan v. Arizona State Tax Commission and Brendale v. Confederated Tribes & Bands of the Yakima Indian Nations, the Court has further eroded tribal sovereignty.
The Court has limited the ability of tribes to exercise jurisdiction over non-Indians on reservations and has asserted its power to define the scope of tribal sovereignty in matters of land-use regulation.


Overall, the Court's treatment of tribal sovereignty has shifted away from the concept of intrinsic tribal sovereignty towards a view that tribal sovereignty exists at the discretion of Congress.
This has led to a progressive diminishment of tribal sovereignty through federal government actions, including those of the Supreme Court.
The Court's role in defining and shaping tribal sovereignty continues to have significant implications for the rights and powers of American Indian tribes in the United States.

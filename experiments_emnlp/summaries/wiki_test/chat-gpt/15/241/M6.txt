Rabban Bar Sauma, a Nestorian Christian from Beijing, embarked on a journey to Jerusalem with his student Rabban Markos in the 1200s.
They detoured through Mongol-controlled Persia and were eventually sent to Europe by Mongol Khan Arghun to negotiate a Franco-Mongol alliance.
Sauma met with various European leaders, including King Phillip IV of France and King Edward I of England, but the alliance never materialized due to internal conflicts.
Sauma returned to Baghdad, where he wrote about his travels.

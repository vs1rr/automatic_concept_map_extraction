The Ilkhanate was one of the four khanates within the Mongol Empire, centered in Persia.
Founded by Hulegu Khan, the dynasty ruled Persia for eighty years, converting to Islam after initial defeats by the Mamluk Egyptians.
Attempts were made to form a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Mamluks, but ultimately both the Later Crusaders and Mongols were ejected from Palestine.
The khanate disintegrated after Abu Sa'id's death, splitting into rival successor states.
Timur later carved a state from the Jalayirids.
The Ilkhanids are represented in FoG army lists, with various Mongol conquests and invasions included.
The army's battle plan typically involves blocking enemy moves, using shooty cavalry, and focusing on disrupting the enemy line of battle.
The army can be effective with a mix of cavalry and light horse units, overwhelming opponents with concentrated attacks.
The Ilkhanids can also include Kurdish lancers and Hospitallers, making them a powerful Mongol option.
By overloading a flank with cavalry and light horse, the Ilkhanids can disrupt and break through enemy lines.
Some players prefer using less expensive, superior, armored lancer cavalry to quickly break through enemy anchors.
Overall, the Ilkhanid Mongol army in FoG requires strategic maneuvering, effective use of shooty cavalry, and a focus on disrupting the enemy to achieve victory.

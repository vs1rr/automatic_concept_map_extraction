The Battle of Ain Jalut took place on September 3, 1260, between the Muslim Mamluks and the Mongols in the southeastern Galilee.
This battle marked the southwesternmost extent of Mongol conquests and was the first time a Mongol advance had been permanently halted.
The sudden death of Khagan Möngke Khan played a significant role in this outcome, as it forced the Mongol Ilkhanate Hulagu Khan to take a large part of his army back with him on the way to Mongolia.
The battle was preceded by years of preparation by Möngke Khan to implement his grandfather Genghis Khan's plan for world empire, with Hulagu leading the task of subduing the nations of the West.
The Mongols had already conquered powerful dynasties and were advancing towards the Mamluk Sultanate when the Battle of Ain Jalut took place.


The Mamluks, led by Saif ad-Din Qutuz and Baibars, faced the Mongols, who also had troops from Georgia and Cilicia.
The Mamluks used hit-and-run tactics and knowledge of the terrain to bait the Mongols into an ambush.
The battle lasted for hours, with the Mamluks eventually surrounding the Mongols on all sides.
Despite a fierce fight, the Mongols were defeated, and their leader Kitbuqa perished along with most of his army.
The Mamluks also used explosive hand cannons in this battle, marking the earliest known use of such weapons.


Following the victory at Ain Jalut, Qutuz was assassinated, and Baibars became the new Sultan.
The Mamluks went on to capture the last of the Crusader states in the Holy Land by 1291.
The defeat at Ain Jalut prevented Hulagu Khan from bringing his full power against the Mamluks, as internal conflicts within the Mongol Empire and raids from the Golden Horde distracted him.
The battle also led to the end of the unified Mongol empire, as subsequent attempts to avenge the defeat were repulsed.
The Battle of Ain Jalut is significant for halting the Mongol advance and showcasing the effectiveness of Mamluk military tactics.

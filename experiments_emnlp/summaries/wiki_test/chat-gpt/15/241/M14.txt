Mongol Armenia, also known as Ilkhanid Armenia, refers to the period from 1236 to 1335 when both Armenia and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia became tributary and vassal to the Mongol Empire.
This relationship began with the submission of Armenian barons to the Mongols, leading to formal agreements and alliances between the two parties.
The Armenians, who were staunchly Christian, found common cause with the Mongols in their military campaigns against the Mameluks, resulting in the capture of Baghdad in 1258.
However, the alliance suffered a defeat eight years later, leading to the demise of the European Crusader States and the failure of the Crusades as a whole.


The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, also known as Lesser Armenia, was formed in the late 12th century by refugees and migrants from Greater Armenia.
The Armenians were friendly to the European Crusaders who arrived in the region, and as the Crusades progressed, they aligned with the Crusader states against the Muslims.
The Mongol Empire, under leaders like Hulagu, advanced towards Persia and the Holy Land, conquering Christian realms in their path.
Armenian leaders like Hasan Jalal and King Hethum I chose to submit to Mongol overlordship, forming alliances and agreements with the Mongols.


Military collaboration between the Armenians and the Mongols began in the 1250s, with combined forces engaging in campaigns against the Mameluks in Syria and Mesopotamia.
The Mongols and their Christian allies achieved victories in cities like Baghdad, Aleppo, and Damascus.
However, the Mongol expansion into the Middle East was halted in 1260 when the Mamluks achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Ain Jalut.
Subsequent attacks by the Mamluks on Cilician Armenia led to losses of territory and ongoing conflicts.


Efforts to revive the alliance between the Armenians and the Mongols continued in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, with campaigns in Syria and attempts to coordinate actions against the Mamluks.
However, internal conflicts, assassinations, and changing political landscapes led to the eventual abandonment of relations between Christian princes and the Mongols.
The fall of Sis in 1375 marked the end of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, with the title claimed by James I of Cyprus.


Overall, the relationship between the Armenians and the Mongols during the Mongol Armenia period was characterized by alliances, military collaboration, and attempts to counter the Mameluk threat in the region.
While the alliance ultimately did not prevent the decline of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, it allowed the Armenians to survive for an additional century in the face of Muslim expansion.

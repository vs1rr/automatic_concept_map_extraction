The Mongol Empire, established by Genghis Khan in 1206, was the largest contiguous empire in history, stretching from Moscow to the South China Sea.
It emerged from the unification of Mongol and Turkic tribes in modern-day Mongolia and grew through invasions.
The empire covered over 33,000,000 kmÂ² and held sway over a population of over 100 million people.
Genghis Khan's military organization was based on a decimal system, and the Mongols were skilled in siege warfare and coordination of combined arms forces.
The empire was governed by a code of law called Yassa, which promoted religious tolerance and strict discipline.
The Mongols were highly tolerant of most religions and sponsored several at the same time.
The empire's military conquests included Central Asia, the Middle East, East Asia, and Europe.
The empire disintegrated after Genghis Khan's death, with the four Khanates becoming independent entities.
The Mongol Empire had a lasting impact on the regions it conquered, unifying large areas and introducing new technologies and cultural exchanges.
The empire's legacy includes the spread of the Y-chromosomal lineage of Genghis Khan and the influence of his descendants in various regions.
Today, Mongolia is proud of its history and identity as a result of the Mongol Empire.

The author of the blog post reflects on the interesting topics that never made it to their site, including the skull of the 'Witch' of Wookey Hole in Somerset, the Ten Bells pub in London, Lord Uxbridge's wooden leg from the Battle of Waterloo, the Chained Oak in Staffordshire, the Cottingley Fairies Camera at the National Media Museum in Bradford, the Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens, and the Tower of London.
The Tower of London, a historic fortress, served as a royal residence, prison, and home to the Crown Jewels.
The Ravens at the Tower are said to protect it from falling.
The Yeomen Warders, or Beefeaters, are former military personnel who serve as guides.
The blog post also mentions the Roman Army unit memorial at the Chesterholm Museum in Hexham, Northumberland, and the Crooked Spire at the Parish Church of Saint Mary and All Saints in Chesterfield.
The twisted spire is believed to be a result of various factors such as the Black Death and unseasoned timber.
Church Open Days are held for visitors to explore the tower.
The author shares their experiences and fascination with these unique and historical sites, providing a glimpse into the rich history and folklore surrounding each location.

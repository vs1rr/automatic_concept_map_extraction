Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, known for creating Sherlock Holmes, fell for the Cottingley Fairies hoax in 1917.
Two young cousins, Elsie and Frances, claimed to have photographed fairies in their garden.
Despite skepticism from Doyle's wife and photographic experts, the pictures were published in The Strand Magazine.
Interest in the photos waned over time, and in 1983, Elsie and Frances admitted they were fakes.
They had cut out illustrations from a children's book and added wings to create the fairy images.
The cousins maintained that they had actually seen fairies, but had only faked the photographs for fun.
The hoax fooled many, including Doyle, who was eager to believe in the supernatural.
The story of the Cottingley Fairies remains a fascinating example of how a simple prank can captivate the public imagination.

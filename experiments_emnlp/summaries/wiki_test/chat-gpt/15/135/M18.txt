The Cottingley Fairies hoax began in 1917 when two girls claimed to have seen fairies by a stream in England.
The girls, Frances and Elsie, took photos of the fairies, which gained attention from the Theosophical Society and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Despite skepticism from some experts, the photos were believed to be real by many.
The hoax lasted for 65 years until Frances and Elsie admitted in 1983 that the photos were fake, created using illustrations from a book.
The girls grew to hate the fairies due to the media attention, and both eventually passed away.
The photos still exist and are valuable collectors' items.
The hoax is considered one of the most interesting in history, showcasing how easily people can be fooled by a well-executed deception.

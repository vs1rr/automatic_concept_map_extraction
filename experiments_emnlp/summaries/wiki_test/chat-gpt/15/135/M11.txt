In July 1917, two girls in Cottingley, England, took photographs of fairies to prove their existence.
The pictures gained attention after being shown at a Theosophist meeting and were later published by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in Strand Magazine.
More photos were taken in 1920, but the girls eventually stopped seeing fairies.

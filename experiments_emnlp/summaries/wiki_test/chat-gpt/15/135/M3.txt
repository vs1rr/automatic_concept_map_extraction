In 1917, two little girls took photos of themselves surrounded by fairies, sparking controversy and accusations of a hoax.
Over the years, they maintained that the photos were genuine, with some suggesting they were taken psychically.
The girls were given photographic plates to take more photos, which were marked to prevent switching.
Famed author Sir Conan Doyle believed in the photos, while others criticized them for resembling magazine cut-outs.
In the 1980s, the girls admitted to faking the photos, but maintained that one was real.
The story of the Cottingley Fairies continues to intrigue and divide opinions, with some believing in the existence of nature spirits and others dismissing the photos as a clever hoax.

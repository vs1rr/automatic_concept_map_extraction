The Convention of 1833 in Mexican Texas was a political gathering of settlers that took place after the Convention of 1832, whose requests had not been addressed by the Mexican government.
Despite the political uncertainty following a civil war, 56 delegates met in San Felipe de Austin to draft petitions to the Mexican government.
Led by William H. Wharton, the convention aimed to pursue independent statehood for Texas, which was part of Coahuila y
Tejas at the time.
Under the guidance of Sam Houston, a state constitution was drafted, combining US political principles with Spanish customs.
Delegates also requested customs exemptions and the lifting of a ban on immigration into Texas.
Stephen F. Austin journeyed to Mexico City to present the petitions, but was imprisoned in early 1834.
The Mexican government passed measures to placate the colonists, including trial by jury.


Background information reveals that Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, establishing a federalist republic.
Texas was merged with Coahuila to form the state of Coahuila y Tejas.
The Mexican government legalized immigration from the US and Europe to discourage native raids.
However, the Law of April 6, 1830, restricted immigration from the US into Texas, leading to discontent among Tejanos and Texians.
General Antonio López de Santa Anna's revolt against President Anastasio Bustamante's centralist government further fueled tensions.


The Convention of 1832 aimed to weaken the Laws of April 6, 1830, but was ruled illegal by Ramón Músquiz.
The lack of Tejano representation led to the Convention of 1833, where delegates pursued separate statehood.
A state constitution was drafted, based on US and Spanish political principles.
Resolutions requested reforms from the Mexican government, including the repeal of the immigration ban and customs duties.
The convention also condemned the slave trade within Texas.


Delegates passed the resolutions and elected Austin, Miller, and Seguín to deliver the petitions to Mexico City.
However, Austin's arrest in December 1834 delayed the process.
The Mexican government enacted measures to appease Texians, including trial by jury and the introduction of American legal concepts.
Despite Austin's imprisonment, he acknowledged that the government had addressed the colonists' grievances.


Overall, the Convention of 1833 in Mexican Texas was a significant event in the region's history, reflecting the tensions between settlers and the Mexican government, as well as the push for independent statehood and reforms.

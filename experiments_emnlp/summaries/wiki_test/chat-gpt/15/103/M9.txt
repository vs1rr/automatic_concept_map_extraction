The Khmer Empire was the largest continuous empire of South East Asia, based in what is now Cambodia.
It seceded from the kingdom of Chenla around 800 C.E. and at times ruled over parts of Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The empire had cultural, political, and trade relations with Java and the Srivijaya empire.
The Khmer Empire's greatest legacy is Angkor, which was the capital during its zenith.
The empire's official religions included Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism, until Theravada Buddhism prevailed in the thirteenth century.
The founder of the Khmer Empire was Jayavarman II, who declared himself the "universal monarch" and established his capital at Hariharalaya.
Successors like Indravarman I and Yasovarman I expanded the kingdom and built temples and reservoirs.
Jayavarman VII, the greatest of the Angkorian kings, constructed the walled city of Angkor Thom and promoted Mahayana Buddhism.
The empire faced conflicts and power struggles in the eleventh century, but under Suryavarman II, it expanded and conquered neighboring territories.
The empire began to decline after the death of Suryavarman II, facing internal strife and attacks from neighboring kingdoms.
The last great king, Jayavarman VII, ruled until the early thirteenth century and promoted Theravada Buddhism.
The empire eventually fell to the Thai kingdom of Ayutthaya in 1431.
The decline of the empire has been attributed to factors such as poor maintenance of water reservoirs, leading to water shortages and population decline.
The history of the Khmer Empire is derived from archaeological excavations, inscriptions, and reports of Chinese diplomats and travelers.
The legacy of the Khmer Empire lives on through the magnificent temples of Angkor, which continue to be a symbol of the empire's power and wealth.

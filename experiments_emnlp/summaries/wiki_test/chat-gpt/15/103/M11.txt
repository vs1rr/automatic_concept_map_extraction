In this text, Bob Acker discusses the mysteries of Angkor and the hydrology involved in the siting of the ancient city.
Angkor was a powerful empire in medieval Southeast Asia, known for its impressive temple complex of Angkor Wat.
The traditional theory suggested that Angkor's greatness was due to irrigation and water control through large water-holding devices called baray.
However, recent research has challenged this theory, showing that the baray could not have irrigated enough land to support Angkor's population.
Acker proposes a new hypothesis that the relocation of the capital to Yaśodharapura was due to the high water-table in the region, which increased agricultural productivity.
He conducted measurements of subsurface water levels in tube wells around Siem Reap province, showing a correlation between high water-tables and Angkorian settlement patterns.
Acker argues that high water-tables made rice cultivation more productive and provided water for domestic animals and fruit trees.
The movement of the capital to Yaśodharapura allowed for a larger, more productive agricultural zone, which in turn provided a readily available workforce for urban construction projects.
Overall, this research highlights the importance of high water-tables in shaping the agricultural practices and settlement patterns of the Khmer people in ancient Cambodia.

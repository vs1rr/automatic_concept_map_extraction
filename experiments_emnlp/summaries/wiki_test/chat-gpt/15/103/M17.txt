Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument on earth, is currently undergoing restoration by a team of Indian archeologists and engineers.
The restoration work, which began in 1986, has sparked a heated debate among experts over whether the monument is being restored to its lost glory or being irreversibly damaged.
The Indians claim they are removing vegetation that is damaging the monument and carefully rebuilding collapsed stone structures, while critics argue that outdated cleaning techniques and dangerous chemicals are scrubbing away detail on the ancient statuary.
The restoration of Angkor Wat is part of a larger argument among scholars and diplomats over how outside nations should cooperate in preserving the complex of more than 70 major temples spread across 25 square miles of the ancient Khmer capital.
Unesco is trying to come up with a blueprint for conserving all the great stone monuments of Angkor, but its work has been hampered by a shortage of money and bickering among outside experts.
The immediate goal is to secure a place on the World Heritage List for Angkor Wat and the other temples, which would allow the United Nations to play a more formal role in overseeing and raising money for restoration work.
However, the Cambodian Government's chaos makes it difficult to come up with a detailed plan for maintaining and policing Angkor.
The restoration work at Angkor Wat is seen as a metaphor for the international effort to bring lasting peace to Cambodia after years of war and genocide.
The Indian team's dedication to the project is evident, but concerns have been raised about the damage being done to the stone and the use of chemicals that could have long-term effects.
The relationship between the Indians and Cambodian laborers is poor, and there is a lack of communication and training for the Cambodians to take over restoration work in the future.
The dispute over the restoration work reflects a larger division within archeology and art conservation, with some experts advocating for a return to the monument's original appearance while others focus on preventing further decay.
The French, who oversaw conservation at Angkor for most of the century, fall into the latter category.
The Indian team's work has been criticized for being a cosmetic quick fix that may not address structural flaws in the monument.
The fear is that Angkor Wat could face neglect and violence if another civil war were to break out.
Despite the flaws in the restoration attempt, Angkor Wat is expected to survive, but the bigger question is how it will weather the challenges of the future.

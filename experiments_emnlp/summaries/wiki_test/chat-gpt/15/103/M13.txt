Angkor Wat is a grand temple monument in Cambodia, part of the larger Angkor Archaeological Park.
Built in the early 12th century as a mausoleum for King Suryavarman II, it is the largest religious monument in the world and a symbol of Cambodia.
The temple complex represents the peak of Khmer architecture and was dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu.
Over the centuries, Angkor Wat has transitioned from a Hindu temple to a center of worship for Theravada Buddhists.
The monument was never completely abandoned and remains an active religious site.
The construction of Angkor Wat required an enormous workforce, including tens of thousands of slaves.
The restoration of the site has been ongoing since the early 1990s, with foreign institutions and private donations funding much of the work.
However, the privatization of the Angkor World Heritage Site has led to concerns about the preservation of the monuments.
Tourism at Angkor Wat has increased significantly since the 1990s, leading to issues such as damage to the ancient buildings, littering, and environmental degradation in the nearby town of Siem Reap.
Despite its popularity as a tourist destination, Angkor Wat continues to face challenges in balancing preservation with the demands of mass tourism.

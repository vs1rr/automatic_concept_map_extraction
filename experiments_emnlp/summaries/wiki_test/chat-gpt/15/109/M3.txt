The Norfolk Coast Path between Blakeney and Cley has faced damage from the December 2013 Storm Surge, leading to repairs being carried out on the sea defences.
The long-term future of the Blakeney Freshes and the coast path is uncertain.
The Environment Agency plans to repair the damaged embankment with a lower and wider crest to withstand future surge events.
Despite the risk of increased flooding, efforts are being made to reinstate the walk.
Alternative routes include following the A149 road, a diversion through Wiveton, or a diversion across Wiveton Downs for stunning views.
The Kings Arms pub in Blakeney offers a historic atmosphere with seafood dishes and a variety of ales.
The pub's interior is decorated with memorabilia of old musical hall stars and movie posters.
The pub has been managed by the family of former owner Howard Davies since his passing in 2010.
The repair work on the coast path aims to secure existing site features in the short term while adapting to sea level rise in the long term.
The future of the area remains uncertain, but efforts are being made to maintain access for walkers.

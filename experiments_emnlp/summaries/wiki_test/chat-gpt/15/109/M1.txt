Awre parish is located in Gloucestershire, between the river Severn and the Forest of Dean.
It contained seven manorial estates, the village of Blakeney, and the hamlet of Gatcombe.
The parish was part of the Forest jurisdiction until the early 14th century.
The land is mainly low-lying, with areas of alluvium and Old Red Sandstone.
Pastoral farming and orchards were common, and the parish had a history of land reclamation from the river Severn.
The parish was also affected by erosion along the river bank.
The Severn's fisheries and river trade were important sources of income.
The main road through the parish was a turnpike from 1757 to 1871, with improvements made under the trust.
The parish was also served by a railway line, opened in 1851, which connected to the Great Western Railway in 1863.
Awre Junction station closed in 1959.
The parish had a network of footpaths connecting farmsteads to the church and chapel.

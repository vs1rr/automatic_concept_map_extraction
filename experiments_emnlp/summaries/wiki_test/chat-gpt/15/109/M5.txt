Blakeney Point, officially known as Blakeney National Nature Reserve, is a National Nature Reserve located near the villages of Blakeney, Morston, and Cley next the Sea on the north coast of Norfolk, England.
The reserve consists of a 6.4 km spit of shingle and sand dunes, salt marshes, tidal mudflats, and reclaimed farmland.
Managed by the National Trust since 1912, the reserve is part of various conservation designations, including the North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest, Natura 2000, Special Protection Area, International Union for Conservation of Nature, and Ramsar listings.
It is also part of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and a World Biosphere Reserve.


The area has a long history of human occupation, with ruins of a medieval monastery and "Blakeney Chapel" buried in the marshes.
The reserve is important for breeding birds, especially terns, and serves as a major site for migrating birds in autumn.
Up to 500 seals may gather at the end of the spit, and the area is home to specialized invertebrates and plants, including edible samphire.


While visitors who come for birdwatching and outdoor activities contribute to the local economy, land-based activities can threaten nesting birds and fragile habitats.
Access restrictions are in place to mitigate these effects, and trips to see the seals are typically done by boat.
The spit is a dynamic structure that is gradually moving towards the coast, causing land loss to the sea.
The River Glaven can become blocked by the advancing shingle, leading to flooding in nearby areas.


The history of the area dates back to the Palaeolithic era, with significant archaeological finds indicating human presence over thousands of years.
Land reclamation schemes in the 17th century led to changes in the coastline and the silting up of river channels.
In the early 1900s, the area became known for wildfowling, and efforts were made to protect bird populations.
The National Trust took over management of Blakeney Point in 1912, establishing it as a protected area for wildlife.


The reserve is home to a variety of bird species, including terns, gulls, waders, and warblers.
Seal colonies, rabbits, insects, and other wildlife also inhabit the area.
Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect the diverse flora and fauna of Blakeney Point while balancing the

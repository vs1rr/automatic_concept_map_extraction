In "The Old Cause" by Joseph R. Stromberg, the author discusses how historical accusations have been turned into defenses in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
Examples include FDR's actions leading up to World War II and the involvement of Stalinists in the Civil Rights Movement.
The text also explores the debate over presidential wars without clear consent from Congress, focusing on Truman's actions in Korea and the UN Charter.
Critics argue that Truman's entry into the Korean War was unconstitutional, while defenders point to precedents and the belief in collective security.
Professor Robert F. Turner argues that the Founders intended for the President to have inherent power to carry out constitutional duties, including making agreements with foreign states.
This raises questions about the extent of presidential power and the role of Congress in declaring war.
Turner's views on the UN Charter highlight the concerns raised by Senator John Bricker and his proposed Bricker Amendment, which aimed to prevent collusion with foreign states from overriding the Constitution.
The text concludes with a reflection on the implications of these debates for the rule of law and the cult of the Constitution.
Overall, Stromberg's analysis delves into the complexities of presidential power, congressional authority, and the balance of power in foreign affairs.

Since World War II, presidents have increasingly used executive agreements to control American foreign relations, rather than relying on the treaty power.
These agreements can be made unilaterally by the president or with the approval of Congress.
However, controversy surrounds the legal authority of the president to make these agreements, as they conflict with the constitutional emphasis on joint decision-making.
Presidents have claimed four sources of constitutional authority to justify executive agreements, but these claims are seen as open-ended and in conflict with congressional powers.
Efforts by Congress to limit the use of executive agreements, such as the Bricker Amendment in 1951, have largely been unsuccessful.
Additionally, attempts to regulate secret executive agreements through the Case Act of 1972 have also faced challenges, as presidents have ignored or circumvented the statute.
Overall, the use of executive agreements has flourished despite the lack of explicit support in the Constitution, raising questions about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches in foreign affairs.

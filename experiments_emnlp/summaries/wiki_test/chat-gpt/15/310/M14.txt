The Statehood Plebiscite in Hawaii in 1959 is often mythologized as a heroic effort by the Statehood Commission and Territorial representative John Burns, but it fails to address the lack of participation in the plebiscite vote.
The plebiscite only offered a choice between statehood or remaining a territory, which does not fulfill the international mandate for self-determination.
Only 35% of eligible voters actively voted for statehood, and there were concerns about the lack of education and understanding among Hawaii residents regarding the plebiscite.
The United Nations Charter mandates the right of self-determination for peoples, and the process of removing Hawaii from the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories raises questions about the legitimacy of the statehood vote.
The analysis of the plebiscite data reveals discrepancies in voter turnout and demographics, leading to doubts about the accuracy and fairness of the statehood vote.
The decision to remove Hawaii from the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories may have been influenced by political considerations rather than legal obligations.
The debate surrounding Hawaii's statehood reflects broader issues of colonialism, international law, and self-governance.

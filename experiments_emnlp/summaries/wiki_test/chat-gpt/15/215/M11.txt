The Invasion of Canada in 1775 was the first major military initiative by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.
The objective was to gain control of Quebec and convince the French-speaking Canadiens to join the revolution.
Two expeditions, one led by Richard Montgomery and the other by Benedict Arnold, set out to capture key forts and cities in the region.
Montgomery successfully captured Fort St. Johns and Montreal, while Arnold faced numerous challenges on his journey through the wilderness of Maine to Quebec City.
The two forces joined at Quebec City but were defeated at the Battle of Quebec in December 1775.


Montgomery's expedition faced logistical challenges but managed to capture Fort St. Johns and Montreal before heading to Quebec.
Arnold's expedition, although successful in reaching Quebec City, suffered from food shortages and difficult terrain.
The Battle of Quebec resulted in the death of Montgomery, the injury of Arnold, and the capture of over 400 men.
The city's defenders, led by General Guy Carleton, were able to repel the American forces.


The French-speaking Canadiens played a role in the conflict, with some supporting the American forces and others siding with the British.
After the defeat at Quebec, the Americans maintained a blockade of the city until spring when British reinforcements arrived.
The retreat of the American forces led to repercussions for their supporters in the region.
The Invasion of Canada highlighted the challenges faced by the Continental Army in its early military campaigns during the Revolutionary War.

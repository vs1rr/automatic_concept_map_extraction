In November 1775, Colonel Benedict Arnold led an American expedition to capture Québec during the American Revolutionary War.
The plan was part of a larger strategy to gain Canadian support for the American cause.
The expedition faced numerous challenges, including harsh weather, difficult terrain, and dwindling supplies.
Despite initial successes in capturing forts along the way, the Americans faced strong resistance in Québec.
Arnold's forces, weakened by casualties and desertions, were unable to take the city.
A joint attack with General Richard Montgomery also failed, resulting in heavy casualties.
The British, under Governor General Guy Carleton, successfully defended Québec, forcing the Americans to retreat.
Arnold, wounded in the battle, continued to lead his troops in a futile siege of the city until reinforcements arrived.
Eventually, the Americans were forced to abandon their efforts in Canada and retreat back to Fort Ticonderoga.
The failed invasion highlighted the challenges faced by the American forces in their quest for independence.

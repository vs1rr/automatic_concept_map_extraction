The cost of Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec in 1775 was determined by analyzing various components.
The first component was the money provided to Arnold by Washington, totaling $66,671 in 1780 dollars.
The second component included unreimbursed costs incurred by American merchants in Canada, totaling $10,831.
Arnold himself also advanced personal money and credit, amounting to $15,360.
The total cost of the expedition was calculated to be $92,862 in 1780 dollars.
When adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index, the value in today's dollars is $1,504,399.00.
This calculation does not include the pay for officers and men, which would have been substantial.
Additionally, claims for reimbursement made by two commanding officers, Captain Oliver Hanchett and Captain William Goodrich, were discussed, but there is no record of these claims being honored.
John Halsted, a merchant in Canada who served as Arnold's Commissary, submitted a claim for $1379.79, which was settled for $1326.80.
Other merchants also submitted claims totaling $9452.
Arnold himself submitted a claim for reimbursement of his personal expenses, which was settled for $15,360.
The total cost of the expedition, including all components, was $92,862 in 1780 dollars.
The value in today's dollars, using the consumer price index, is $1,504,399.00.
This figure does not include the pay for officers and men, which would have further increased the total cost.

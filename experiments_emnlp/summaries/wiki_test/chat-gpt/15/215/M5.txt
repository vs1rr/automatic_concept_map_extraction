Benedict Arnold, a U.S. general during the American Revolutionary War, is infamous for betraying America and defecting to the British side.
Before his betrayal, Arnold fought bravely in battles such as Saratoga.
He was born in 1741 in Connecticut, named after his great-grandfather, and had a successful business.
Arnold was a member of the Sons of Liberty and married Margaret Mansfield, with whom he had three sons.
He played a key role in capturing Fort Ticonderoga and led an ill-fated expedition to Quebec.
Arnold commanded the American fleet at Valcour Island and made significant contributions at the Battles of Saratoga.
He later served as governor of Philadelphia, where he faced accusations of corruption.
By 1779, Arnold had become a traitor, providing the British with valuable information.
He planned to betray West Point for money and a British army command, but the plot was exposed, leading to his escape and Major John Andr√©'s hanging.
Arnold fought for the British against America and died in London in 1801.
Despite his contributions to the American Revolution, Arnold's name became synonymous with "traitor" in the U.S. Monuments referencing his contributions do not bear his name.
In an open letter titled "To the Inhabitants of America," Arnold justified his actions by criticizing the corruption and tyranny of the Continental Congress and the Patriot leadership.

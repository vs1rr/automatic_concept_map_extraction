Benedict Arnold was born on January 14, 1741/42 in Norwich, Connecticut, to Benedict Arnold and Hannah King.
He came from an old and distinguished New England family, with ancestors who held prominent positions in the past.
Arnold's father faced business failures and turned to heavy drinking, leading to financial ruin for the family.
Arnold began his career as an apothecary apprentice but ran away to enlist in the Seven Years' War.
After his father's death, he moved to New Haven, where he established a trading business and traveled along the American coast and the West Indies.


When the American Revolution broke out in 1775, Arnold was eager to defend colonial liberties against British oppression.
He played a significant role in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga and other British positions on Lake Champlain.
However, his leadership was marred by conflicts with other officers and disputes over command.
Arnold also led an expedition into Quebec, where he demonstrated his military prowess and courage.


Arnold's most notable contribution to the American cause came during the Saratoga campaign in 1777, where he played a crucial role in the defeat of British General Burgoyne.
Despite his military successes, Arnold faced personal and professional challenges, including disputes with Congress and accusations of misconduct.
These conflicts eventually led Arnold to betray the American cause and defect to the British.


After his defection, Arnold received rewards and a commission in the British army.
He participated in military expeditions in the West Indies and continued his trading activities.
Arnold's last years were marked by financial difficulties and legal disputes in Saint John, New Brunswick.
He later returned to England, where he faced health issues and financial struggles.
Arnold died on June 14, 1801, and was buried in London.


Despite his military talents and contributions to the American cause, Benedict Arnold's name has become synonymous with treason and betrayal in American history.
His decision to defect to the British side tarnished his legacy and overshadowed his earlier achievements as a skilled military leader.
Arnold's life serves as a cautionary tale of the consequences of personal ambition and betrayal in the pursuit of power and recognition.

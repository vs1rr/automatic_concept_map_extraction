In late June 1775, George Merchant enlisted as a private in one of the six rifle companies raised by Congress from Pennsylvania and Virginia.
The rifle companies joined the Patriot army surrounding Boston, where they had little to do other than take occasional shots at British soldiers.
Plans were developed for an invasion of Canada, with one force under General Richard Montgomery attacking Montreal and another force under General Benedict Arnold taking a difficult route through Maine to Quebec.
The expedition faced numerous challenges, including difficult terrain, sickness, and starvation.
George Merchant was captured while on sentry duty in Quebec, and the circumstances of his capture remain unclear.
He was sent to England but eventually returned to America with important documents revealing British plans to hire German mercenaries and details of military operations in Canada, Boston, and Virginia.
Merchant's story raises questions about his capture, time in England, and the information he carried.
Despite his involvement in significant events, much about George Merchant remains unknown.

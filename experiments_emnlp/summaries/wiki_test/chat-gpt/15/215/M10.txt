Hikers in Maine can now explore a 13-mile segment of history by walking in the footsteps of Benedict Arnold and his troops on their expedition to Quebec City in 1775.
The Arnold Expedition Historical Society has opened the Great Carrying Place Portage Trail, allowing modern hikers to experience the challenging journey Arnold's army faced.
The trail begins at Carrying Place Stream and follows a route that Native Americans used centuries ago to bypass dangerous rapids on the Kennebec River.
Hikers can choose to walk the trail in short segments, as a day hike, or as an overnight journey with a stay at the AT lean-to on West Carry Pond.

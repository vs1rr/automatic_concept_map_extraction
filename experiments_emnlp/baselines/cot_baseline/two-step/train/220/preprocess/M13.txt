One word: agriculture More food = more soldiers.
A reason why France, for instance, didnt see colonial empires as must-have during the ancient-régime:
France was rich enough to sustain a big army without colonies.
Our kings saw the colonies only are a bonus, and Napoléon didnt believe in them at all.
(they were all wrong)Note: the french had a colonial empire, and a rather big one too. 12,347,000 km² (4,767,000 sq. miles) for the french against 13,000,000 square miles 33,670,000 km² (13,000,000 sq. miles) for the British Empire... modest yes! but still...

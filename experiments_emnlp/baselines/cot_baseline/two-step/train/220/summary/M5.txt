Britain's fragile peace after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 marked the end of a long global conflict. Despite fears of renewed war, Britain emerged as a dominant imperial power, with a strong navy securing global supremacy. The British Empire comprised diverse elements, including white colonies in North America, strategic territories like South Africa, and a vast eastern empire in India. The Caribbean sugar colonies and West African settlements also played a significant role in Britain's expanding empire. The growth of this empire was influenced by personal ambitions, commercial interests, and global warfare, rather than a deliberate plan. The complex interactions with different societies and rulers shaped Britain's empire by 1815.

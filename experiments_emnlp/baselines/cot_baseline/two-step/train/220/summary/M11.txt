The British Empire was the largest empire in history, covering a quarter of the Earth's landmass and governing a fifth of the world's population. Starting in the 15th century, England's late entry into trans-oceanic exploration led to a focus on maritime strength. Queen Elizabeth I's reign marked the beginning of England's transition into an empire, with a focus on trade and expansion. The 17th century saw colonization efforts in North America and the Caribbean, with a shift towards the latter due to the profitability of sugar cane. The 18th century brought naval supremacy and victories over European rivals, leading to increased urbanization and emigration to British colonies. The 19th century saw the Royal Navy's global dominance and expansion into Asia and Africa, with a focus on trade and control of key territories. The 20th century saw the empire's decline due to economic challenges, World Wars, and decolonization efforts. By the mid-20th century, the empire had dismantled, leaving a lasting legacy on language, legal systems, and global migration patterns.

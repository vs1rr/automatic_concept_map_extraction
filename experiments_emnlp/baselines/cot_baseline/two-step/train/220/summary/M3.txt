A protectorate is a dependent territory granted local autonomy by a greater sovereign state while retaining suzerainty. Protectorates differ from colonies as they have local rulers and limited immigration. Protectorates may have favorable terms, and in modern times, they are seen in microstates. Protectorates have limited foreign relations and rely on the protecting power for defense. Examples include British protectorates like Zanzibar and Solomon Islands. Protectorates are distinct from League of Nations Mandates and United Nations Trust Territories. British protectorates like Zanzibar and Solomon Islands gained independence in the 20th century. Other countries, such as the United States, also had protectorates like Liberia and Panama Canal Zone.

The California Gold Rush of 1848-1858 began with the discovery of gold by James W. Marshall, leading to a massive influx of immigrants known as "'49ers." The population of California grew rapidly, leading to its incorporation as the 31st state in 1850. The gold rush attracted fortune-seekers from around the world, including China, Germany, Chile, Mexico, Ireland, Turkey, and France. The influx of foreign laborers led to ethnic tensions and the enactment of the Foreign Miners Tax in 1850. Despite the tensions, the Gold Rush transformed California into one of the most ethnically diverse states in the Union by the mid-19th century.

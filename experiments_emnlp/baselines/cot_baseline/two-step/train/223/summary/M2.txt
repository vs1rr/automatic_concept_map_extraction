The Byzantine Empire, formed after the split of the Roman Empire, thrived for 1000 years ruling Eastern and Southern Europe. Emperor Constantine I established Constantinople as the capital and embraced Christianity. The peak of the empire was during the Justinian Dynasty, with Emperor Justinian I expanding territory and implementing reforms, including the famous Justinian Code. The empire split from the Catholic Church in 1054 and fought against Muslims for control of the eastern Mediterranean. In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire. Byzantine art focused on religion, Latin was the official language until 700 CE, and Constantinople was attacked during the Fourth Crusade. The empire had a lasting impact on Europe for nearly 2000 years.

The Byzantine Empire, a continuation of the Roman Empire, thrived for over a thousand years until its fall in 1453. Initially part of the Roman Empire, it evolved into a powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. The empire underwent significant changes, such as the shift to Greek culture and Orthodox Christianity. It reached its peak under rulers like Justinian I, expanding its territories and influencing art and architecture. Despite facing periods of decline and territorial losses, the Byzantine Empire left a lasting legacy on European civilization, shaping Orthodox Christianity, preserving classical knowledge, and influencing Renaissance humanism. The Ottomans, who conquered Constantinople in 1453, saw themselves as heirs to the Byzantine legacy, preserving aspects of its tradition.

The Byzantines, a bridge between the Classical and Post-Classical era, thrived from 330 C.E. when Constantine moved his capital to Byzantium, later Constantinople. Known for their religious buildings and art, such as the iconic Hagia Sophia, they were a dominant economic force until the Turks conquered Istanbul in 1453. The Turks, with a history dating back over 4,000 years, settled in Anatolia after the Malazgirt victory in 1071. The Anatolian Seljuk State, part of the Great Seljuk Empire, flourished with mosques, universities, and the legacy of Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi. Following the collapse of the Seljuk Empire, the Ottoman Beylik emerged, uniting Turkish beyliks in Anatolia and leading to the rise of the Ottoman Empire, which ended the Byzantine rule in 1453.

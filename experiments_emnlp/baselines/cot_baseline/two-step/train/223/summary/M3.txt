The Byzantine Empire, also known as Byzantium, was the continuation of the Roman Empire centered on Constantinople. It reached its height under the Macedonian emperors, but eventually declined and fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. Notable achievements include the codification of Roman law under Justinian and the construction of the Hagia Sophia. Byzantine culture was influenced by Hellenization and theocracy, and the empire played a key role in passing on classical culture to Renaissance Italy and Europe.

The Byzantine Empire, a Greek-speaking continuation of the Roman Empire, thrived for over a thousand years until its fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Initially part of the Roman Empire, it evolved into a powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. The empire underwent various transitions, including the adoption of Greek as the official language and the establishment of Orthodox Christianity. Despite periods of decline and recovery, the empire reached its peak under rulers like Justinian I, who expanded its territories and built iconic structures like the Hagia Sophia. However, attacks by Persians, Slavs, and Muslims, as well as internal conflicts like Iconoclasm, weakened the empire. The Crusades further strained relations with the West, leading to the sacking of Constantinople in 1204. The empire's final centuries saw a gradual decline, culminating in its fall in 1453 when Constantinople was conquered by the Ottomans.

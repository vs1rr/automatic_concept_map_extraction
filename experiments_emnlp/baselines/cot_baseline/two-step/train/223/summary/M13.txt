The Byzantine-Sassanid War (602-628) was a significant conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires. It began with Khosrau II's invasion of Byzantine land in 602, seeking revenge for the death of his ally, Emperor Maurice. The war saw early successes for the Sassanids, with rebellions breaking out in the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Heraclius took charge and turned the tide by defeating Sassanid armies and using strategic tactics. The war culminated in a series of battles, with Heraclius ultimately emerging victorious. Despite facing challenges from other enemies, Heraclius managed to secure peace and return to Constantinople in triumph.

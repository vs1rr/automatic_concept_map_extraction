The Fall of Constantinople in 1453 marked the end of the Byzantine Empire as Sultan Mehmed II led the Ottoman Turks in a siege against the heavily fortified city. With superior numbers and tactics, the Turks breached the walls and overtook the city after a fierce battle. The conquest led to the renaming of the city to Istanbul and the establishment of new rules for the conquered inhabitants.

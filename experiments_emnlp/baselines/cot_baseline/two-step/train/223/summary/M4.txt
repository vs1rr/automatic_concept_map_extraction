Constantinople, also known as Byzantium, New Rome, and Istanbul, was the capital city of the Eastern Roman Empire after the fall of Rome. Established by Constantine in the early 4th century, the city was strategically located on a promontory with natural and man-made fortifications, including defensive walls and a harbor. The city boasted 7 hills like Rome and was a significant hub for sea trade. Constantinople's importance is evident in its various forums built by different emperors before the fall of Rome.

The fall of Constantinople in 1453 marked a significant turning point in warfare history, showcasing the power of gunpowder and the end of traditional defenses. Despite the tragic events, the Muslim conquest inadvertently preserved the doctrinal integrity of eastern Christendom. The fall of Constantinople also led to the shift of power dynamics in Europe, the flight of Greek scholars to Italy, and the emergence of conflicts between empires in southeastern Europe. The repercussions of this event are still felt today, influencing relationships and alliances in the region.

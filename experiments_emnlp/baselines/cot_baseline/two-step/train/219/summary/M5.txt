The Manhattan Project during World War II was a top-secret U.S. initiative to develop the atomic bomb before Germany or Japan. Initiated by a warning from Albert Einstein to President Roosevelt, the project aimed to prevent Axis powers from creating nuclear weapons. The project was named after the Manhattan Engineering District and involved multiple research sites, with Los Alamos being the primary location for bomb development. The first atomic bomb was detonated at Trinity in New Mexico in 1945, leading to the subsequent bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The project's secrecy was maintained even from Vice President Truman until after Roosevelt's death. The use of atomic bombs raised ethical debates among scientists, but ultimately Japan surrendered, marking the beginning of the nuclear age and a new era in warfare.

The Manhattan Project was a top-secret American initiative during WWII to build the first atomic bomb. It was launched in response to fears that the Nazis were also developing powerful atomic weapons. Led by key figures like President Franklin Roosevelt and scientists like Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi, the project involved collaboration with Britain and Canada. The first atomic bomb was tested in 1945 and later dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of WWII. The project marked the beginning of the nuclear age and had a lasting impact on the development of atomic weapons worldwide.

The Manhattan Project was a research and development project that produced the first atomic bombs during World War II. Led by the United States with support from the United Kingdom and Canada, the project began in 1942 under Major General Leslie Groves. It grew to employ over 130,000 people and cost nearly $2 billion. The project developed two types of atomic bombs using uranium-235 and plutonium. The timeline covers events from the project's inception in 1939 to its formal replacement by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947, including key milestones like the first nuclear reactor going critical in 1942 and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

The "CSI effect" is a concern due to the exaggerated portrayal of forensic science in popular TV shows like "CSI," "NCIS," and "Bones." Viewers may develop unrealistic expectations of how evidence is collected and analyzed, leading to potential issues in the courtroom. The demand for forensic evidence has increased, influenced by the attention on forensic scientists in media. As technology advances, people may expect quick and definitive results like those seen on TV, which can impact their perception of real-life investigations. The challenge lies in balancing entertainment with accuracy in portraying forensic science.

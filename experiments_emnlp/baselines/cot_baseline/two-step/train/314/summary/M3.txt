The CSI effect refers to the exaggerated portrayal of forensic science on TV shows, leading to unrealistic public perceptions. It influences public perception by distorting what crime scene investigators and forensic scientists do, depicting technologies that do not exist, creating unrealistic expectations for evidence collection and analysis, and presenting outcomes much faster than reality. This effect is important as public expectations may impact jury trials, leading to a focus on forensic evidence like on CSI. It affects criminal investigations by making jurors expect more forensic evidence than necessary and having excessive confidence in forensic and DNA evidence. The CSI effect has led to a rise in jurors wrongly acquitting defendants due to specific evidence expectations. Legal preparation for prosecutors has changed to address the limitations of forensic science, while jury selection now considers potential jurors' TV show preferences. Defense attorneys have new ways to create doubt in jurors' minds, and potential criminals have become more educated due to the CSI effect.

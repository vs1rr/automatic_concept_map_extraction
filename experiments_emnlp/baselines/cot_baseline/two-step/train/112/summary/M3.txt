The Book of Kells is a renowned example of Celtic and Irish art, known for its intricate knotwork patterns, vibrant colors, and angular runic font. Despite being a national symbol of Ireland, its exact origins remain a subject of debate. Created by Columban monks, the Book of Kells is a copy of the New Testament made from calfskin vellum and adorned with a wide array of colors derived from various materials. The book, believed to have originated in Iona and later moved to Kells and Dublin, is now displayed at Trinity College Library. The elaborate illuminations in the Book of Kells required meticulous craftsmanship and a diverse range of dyes from sources far and wide, showcasing the beauty and complexity of Celtic art.

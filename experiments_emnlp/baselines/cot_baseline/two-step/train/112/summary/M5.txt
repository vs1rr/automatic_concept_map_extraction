The Book of Kells, a famous illuminated manuscript also known as the Book of Columba, was created by Celtic monks around AD 800 in the Insular art style. Despite debates about its origin, it is believed to have been produced by Columban monks associated with the community at Iona. The manuscript contains the four gospels written in colorful inks and intricate artwork. While the exact production details remain uncertain, the book's surviving pages showcase elaborate decorations and illustrations, making it a remarkable example of Insular art.

The Book of Kells, housed in the Manuscripts & Archives Research Library at Trinity College Dublin, is a medieval illuminated manuscript containing the four Gospels in Latin. Written on vellum in a script known as "insular majuscule," it includes various prefaces and Gospel passages. The book's dimensions are approximately 33 x 25 cm, and it is richly decorated with intricate Celtic designs. The digital surrogates of the manuscript were scanned from transparencies in 1990.

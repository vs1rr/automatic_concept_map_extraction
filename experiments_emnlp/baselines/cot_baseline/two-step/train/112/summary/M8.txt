The Old Library in Dublin, Ireland, houses the famous Book of Kells, along with other ancient manuscripts like the Book of Armagh and the Book of Mulling. The Book of Kells, known for its intricate decoration, likely originated from the monastery on Iona and survived Viking raids before being taken to Dublin for safekeeping. The library also features the impressive Long Room, filled with historic books and artifacts, including a fifteenth-century harp and the original printing of the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic.

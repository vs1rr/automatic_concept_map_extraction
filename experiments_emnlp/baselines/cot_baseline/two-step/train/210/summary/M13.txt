The Late Period of Ancient Egypt marked the decline of Egyptian power before Persian conquests. It includes the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty, known as the Saite Period, and the First Persian Occupation during the Twenty-Seventh Dynasty. The Twenty-Eighth to Thirtieth Dynasties saw a rebellion by Amyrtaeus against the Persians, while the Thirtieth Dynasty's defeat led to re-occupation. The Thirty-First Dynasty experienced a Second Persian Occupation. References include works by Roberto B. Gozzoli, Alan B. Lloyd, and Stephen Quirke.

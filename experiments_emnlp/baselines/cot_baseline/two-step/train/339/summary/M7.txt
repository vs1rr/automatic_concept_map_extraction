The text by Publius Huldah rebukes nullification deniers who claim that nullification by States of unconstitutional acts of the federal government is unlawful and impossible. The deniers, including individuals from organizations like the Heritage Foundation and the Human Events, make false assertions that contradict historical documents and the principles of the Founding Fathers. The text explains the conditions necessary for nullification to be proper and possible, the concepts of interposition and nullification, and the importance of understanding the Founding Principles. It also addresses the misconceptions and false assertions made by nullification deniers, emphasizing the natural right of self-defense and the reserved power of nullification within the 10th Amendment. The text concludes by urging readers to reject misinformation, learn from the Founding Documents, and stand against the encroaching tyranny of the federal government.

James Madison, born in 1751, was raised in privilege in Virginia, where he developed a passion for politics and intellectual pursuits. His career in politics began during the imperial crisis, leading to his involvement in the Virginia Convention and the Continental Congress. Madison played a key role in shaping the Constitution and promoting its ratification. As a congressman, he championed individual rights and clashed with Alexander Hamilton over financial policies, leading to the formation of political parties. Madison served as Secretary of State under Jefferson, overseeing foreign policy and the Louisiana Purchase. As president, he faced challenges with France and Great Britain, ultimately declaring war in 1812. Despite setbacks, Madison's presidency saw the end of the War of 1812 and a focus on domestic affairs. In retirement, he continued to be active in public life, advocating against doctrines of nullification and states' rights until his death in 1836.

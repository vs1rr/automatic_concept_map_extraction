The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 were influential statements passed by the state legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia, written by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison respectively. These resolutions opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, introduced the theory of nullification and interposition, and asserted that states could reject federal laws deemed unconstitutional. Despite being rejected by other states, these resolutions became central to Jefferson's party and influenced the concept of states' rights, later playing a role in the Nullification Crisis of 1832 and the Southern secession leading to the Civil War. The ideas behind the resolutions were ultimately rejected during the Civil War and did not resurface afterwards.

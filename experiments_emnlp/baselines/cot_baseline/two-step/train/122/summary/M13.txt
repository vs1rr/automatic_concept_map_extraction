A walk through Bruce Castle Park and Tottenham Cemetery led to a meeting with a helpful Harringey Council official. The park houses a museum featuring the history of the Royal Mail, once owned by Sir Rowland Hill. The museum also holds the archive of Wood Green Empire, where the narrator's father worked on posters and programs. Despite its proximity to recent riots, the area proved to be a surprising and historically rich location.

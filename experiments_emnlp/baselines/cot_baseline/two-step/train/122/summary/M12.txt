Bruce Castle in Tottenham, dating back to 1686, is the second most famous building in the area after White Hart Lane Stadium. Originally owned by the Bruis family, it was later acquired by Sir William Compton and hosted notable figures like Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The house was known as 'The Lordship' until it was renamed by Lord Coleraine. The tower on the property was built to house falcons. In the 19th century, it became a progressive school and later a museum. Over the years, the house underwent renovations to align with Georgian architectural styles. Today, Bruce Castle stands as a museum with exhibitions on Haringey's history and Rowland Hill.

A statue of Alice Nutter, one of the Pendle witches accused of murder by witchcraft in 1612, will be placed in Roughlee to commemorate the 400th anniversary of her death. The statue, yet to be designed, will sit on Blacko Bar Road on ground donated by a descendant of Ms Nutter. The parish council has set strict guidelines for interested artists, emphasizing the need to celebrate her unfairly treated status and represent the year 1612. The statue will also include a sitting area and aims to move away from her witch image, highlighting her unique circumstances during the Pendle Trials. Alice Nutter, perceived differently from the other accused witches due to her wealth and silence during trial, was executed in 1612 for allegedly bewitching a man to death. The statue is expected to be completed by April 2012, ahead of the anniversary of her execution.

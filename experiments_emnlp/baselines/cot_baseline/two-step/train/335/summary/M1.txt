The Pendle Witch trials in 1612 were a significant event in English history, with twelve accused individuals from Lancashire charged with using witchcraft to murder ten people. Most were tried and executed, with the trials documented in "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster." The trials were unusual for England at the time, with more than two percent of all English witch trial executions attributed to this case. The accused came from two families, with allegations possibly stemming from competition between them for livelihoods based on witchcraft practices.

San Felipe de Austin served as the colonial capital of the Anglo colonies in Mexican Texas during the 1820s. Stephen F. Austin played a significant role in the conventions held there in 1832 and 1833, where colonists discussed grievances and proposed changes to the Mexican government. Despite efforts to seek separate statehood and address immigration restrictions, the resolutions were never presented to Mexico. Austin's imprisonment in 1834 led to his support for an independent Texas. The movement gained momentum, culminating in a provisional state government established in San Felipe during the Texas Revolution. The events leading to Texas independence were closely tied to Austin's headquarters in San Felipe de Austin.

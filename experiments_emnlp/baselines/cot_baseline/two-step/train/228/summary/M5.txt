Mexico's migration policy for Texas was similar to that for California and New Mexico. US citizen Moses Austin acquired land in Texas in 1820, confirmed by Mexico in 1823. Stephen F. Austin sold land to settlers, attracting many due to affordable prices and fertile land. Mexico imposed restrictions on land ownership by foreigners, leading to tensions with Anglo settlers. Political turmoil in Mexico, including Santa Anna's rise to power, fueled unrest in Texas. The Alamo became a symbol of resistance, with a bloody battle resulting in Mexican victory. Santa Anna's harsh measures led to further conflict, culminating in the Battle of San Jacinto where Sam Houston's forces defeated Santa Anna. Santa Anna's capture led to negotiations for Texas' independence, eventually recognized by the US and European countries, despite Mexico's refusal.

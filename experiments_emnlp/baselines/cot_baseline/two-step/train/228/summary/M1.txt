In 1833, a new convention was held in San Felipe, Texas, with a more aggressive approach than before. Only a quarter of the delegates from the previous gathering attended, with William H. Wharton presiding and Sam Houston emerging as a new leader. The main agenda remained similar, with the addition of drafting a constitution to be presented to the Mexican congress. Despite initial positive meetings, Stephen F. Austin was later imprisoned without charges, returning to Texas just before the Texas Revolution in 1835.

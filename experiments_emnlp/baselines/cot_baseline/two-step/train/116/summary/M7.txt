Jacobean architecture, prevalent during the reigns of King James I and VI and Charles I in England, was a blend of Flemish, French, and Italian Renaissance influences. It featured jewelled strapwork, grotesque ornamentation, and elements like emblems, herms, and obelisks. While incorporating Gothic elements such as mullioned windows, it also favored curved and Dutch gables. Notable examples include Hatfield House, Bramshill, and Audley End. Inigo Jones's Italian style stood apart from traditional Jacobean architecture. A revival in the 19th century combined Jacobean and Queen Anne styles, resulting in unique structures like R. N. Shaw's New Zealand Chambers in London.

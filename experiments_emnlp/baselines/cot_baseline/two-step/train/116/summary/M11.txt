Bramshill House, a Jacobean-style building constructed in the early 17th century, now serves as a police staff training college. The house features symmetrical elevations, a narrow interior court, and a red tile roof with large gables. Built from red brick with stone dressings, it includes a stone balustrade parapet, detailed windows, and an elaborate entrance. The south entrance front boasts a three-story stone porch added in 1703. Since 1960, the house has been home to the principal police staff training college in the UK and, since 2007, part of the National Policing Improvement Agency. A refurbishment program is set to be completed by 2014.

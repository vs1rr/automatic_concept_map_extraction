Brougham Castle, originally a Roman fort site, was later taken over by the Norman family of Vieuxpont to build their castle. The current castle was founded by Hugh de Morville in the 12th century and later passed through various owners. It fell into disrepair during the 13th and 14th centuries due to Scottish raids. Lady Anne Clifford restored the castle in the 17th century, making it her home until her death in 1676. The castle eventually fell into ruin, with stone taken for other constructions. Today, Brougham Castle remains an impressive and well-preserved ruin in Cumbria, overlooking the River Eamont.

Brougham Castle in Cumbria, built in the early 13th Century by Robert de Vieuxpont, is strategically located between the rivers Lowther and Eamont. Initially a stone keep and bailey, the castle saw ownership changes, improvements, and conflicts over the centuries. The de Clifford family took over in 1269, with Robert de Clifford enhancing defenses during the Anglo-Scottish War. The castle was briefly captured by the Scots in 1388 and later fell into disrepair. Lady Anne Clifford restored it in the 17th Century, hosting James I in 1617. After her death in 1676, the castle deteriorated until it came under state ownership in the 1930s, now managed by English Heritage and open to the public.

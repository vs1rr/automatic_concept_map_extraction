Brougham Castle, located near Penrith in Westmorland, has a rich history dating back to a Roman fort on the site. Built by the Norman family of Vieuxpont, the castle later came under the ownership of Robert Clifford, who strengthened its defenses during the Scottish wars. Lady Anne Clifford inherited the castle in 1643 and spent years restoring it and other castles in the area. Visitors can explore the impressive ruins, including the oldest standing part, the keep, with its historic rooms and views of the surrounding area. The castle is now under the care of English Heritage, offering a shop, exhibitions, and a guidebook detailing its history and significance.

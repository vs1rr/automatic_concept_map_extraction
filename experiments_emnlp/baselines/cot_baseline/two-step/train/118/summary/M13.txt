Brougham Castle, built around 1214 by Robert de Vieuxpont to defend against King John's enemies, was strategically located at a crossing point of rivers and roads. Over the years, various improvements were made by the Cliffords to strengthen the castle against Scottish attacks during the Anglo-Scottish wars. Despite being captured and sacked in 1388, the castle saw some activity in the early 15th century when a man was accused of forging coins within its walls.

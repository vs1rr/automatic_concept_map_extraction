Brough Castle, located near the A66 in Brough, is a historic site dating back to 1090, built on the remains of a Roman fort called Verteris. Initially constructed by William Rufus as a defense against the Scots, the castle saw various sieges and changes of ownership over the centuries. The Clifford family added significant structures to the castle until a fire in 1521 left it in ruins. Lady Anne Clifford initiated restoration works in the 17th century, but the castle eventually fell into disrepair until it was taken over by the Ministry of Works in 1920. Today, Brough Castle is maintained by English Heritage and is open to visitors free of charge.

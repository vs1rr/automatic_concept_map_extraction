Alton Castle, built in 1170, stands on a hill overlooking the Churnet Valley, protected by a cliff and a rock-cut ditch. The remaining walls and gatehouse date back to the late 12th and early 13th centuries. After being slighted in the Civil War, a new residence, Alton Towers, was constructed in the 18th century. In the 19th century, a mock castle was built nearby. Located on B5032, 7 miles north of Uttoxeter Castle Hill Rd, Alton, Stoke-on-Trent ST10 4TT.

Medieval castles were fortified structures that provided protection to nobility and others, with some used for strategic positioning. They originated in the 9th and 10th centuries in Europe, built by nobles to control areas and safeguard their families and wealth. Castles owned by the king and Anglo-Norman Lords were prominent, offering the best protection. Designs evolved over time, with Normans introducing advanced designs. Castles were strategically located for survival, like on mountain passes or near rivers. Concentric castles with multiple outer walls became popular for their strong defenses. Early medieval castles were simpler, while later designs were more sophisticated. Castle entertainment was important for morale, and castle staff played crucial roles in maintaining the castles. Famous medieval castles like Warwick and Windsor in England are well-known examples. Castles were essential for defense during sieges, with various weapons used for attacks. Today, many medieval castles are tourist attractions, showcasing their historical significance and architectural features.

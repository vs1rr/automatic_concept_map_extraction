Stone castles in Co. Tipperary from the 12th century controlled the area, replacing earlier earth and timber structures. They were expensive to build, requiring many workers. These castles served as offensive and defensive bases, centers of administration, and symbols of power. They were strategically located near vital resources and travel routes. Norman invaders established many castles, holding court to ensure obedience. Gunpowder's impact on castle construction was felt in the 15th century, leading to the decline of castles in favor of artillery forts and more comfortable houses.

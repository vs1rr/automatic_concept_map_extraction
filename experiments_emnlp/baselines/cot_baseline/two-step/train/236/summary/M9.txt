Brazilian Independence began with the arrival of King Dom Jo√£o VI in 1808, making Brazil part of the United Kingdom of Portugal. In 1820, Portugal's Constitutional Revolution led to demands for the king's return, leaving his son Dom Pedro as Regent Prince. Tensions rose as the Cortes tried to subdue Brazil, leading to uprisings by Bonificans and Liberals. Dom Pedro, feeling manipulated, declared Brazil's independence in 1822, becoming Emperor Dom Pedro I.

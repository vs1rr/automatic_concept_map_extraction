The Brazilian Empire, existing from 1822 to 1889, was a stable state led by Dom Pedro I and Dom Pedro II. It expanded its borders through wars and interventions, maintaining political stability, economic growth, and democratic principles. After defeating Portugal, Brazil became fully independent and established a bicameral parliament. Dom Pedro II's reign brought peace and stability, with Brazil emerging as an international power. The empire participated in various wars, including the War of the Triple Alliance, and abolished slavery in 1888. However, with no viable heir, the monarchy ended in 1889 with the Proclamation of the Republic.

Brazil was under Portuguese rule for 81 years, first as part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves, and later as the independent Empire of Brazil. The Portuguese court moved to Rio de Janeiro to escape Napoleon's troops, leading to Brazil's elevation from a colony to a kingdom. When the king wanted to return to Europe, Brazilians chose to remain independent. To maintain control, his son declared Brazil's independence, keeping both nations under the Orleans-Braganza royal family. The Portuguese branch of the family is more royalist, but attitudes may be shifting.

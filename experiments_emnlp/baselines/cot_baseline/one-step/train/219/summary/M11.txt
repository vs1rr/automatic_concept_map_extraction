Britain's journey in developing nuclear weapons began with the MAUD Committee in 1940, leading to key breakthroughs in fission bomb design. Cooperation with the U.S. and Canada continued through WWII, with British scientists contributing to the Manhattan Project. Post-war, Prime Minister Attlee established a secret committee to develop atomic policy, eventually leading to physicist William Penney heading Britain's atomic bomb program. The first British nuclear test, codenamed Hurricane, took place in 1952 off the coast of Australia, marking a significant milestone in Britain's nuclear weapons program.

Bruce Castle Museum is a Grade I listed 16th-century manor house with a rich history. Built by William Compton, a member of Henry VIIIâ€™s court, the building has been modified over the years by various owners, including the Coleraine family. The site also housed a progressive school for boys run by Sir Rowland Hill, known for reforming the British postal system. Today, the museum showcases the local history collections of the Borough of Haringey and offers archives for research. Visitors can explore the museum from Wednesday to Sunday, with free admission, but it is recommended to book in advance for the archives Search Room.

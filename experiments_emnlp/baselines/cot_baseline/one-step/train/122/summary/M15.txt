Bruce Castle Park in Haringey is located on the site of one of the four manors of Tottenham, with the only remaining mansion in the area. The park has a rich history dating back to the Scottish royal family of de Brus. The present house was likely built in the 1620s, and the park was opened in 1892, becoming Tottenham's first public park. The park features historical buildings, including a C16th circular red brick tower, and offers various recreational activities. Bruce Castle Park has a museum that houses a local history collection and has won a Green Flag Award for several consecutive years.

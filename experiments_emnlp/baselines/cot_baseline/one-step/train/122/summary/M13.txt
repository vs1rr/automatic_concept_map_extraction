A walk through Bruce Castle Park and Tottenham Cemetery led to a meeting with a helpful Harringey Council official. The museum at Bruce Castle Park, once owned by Sir Rowland Hill, features a history of the Royal Mail. The narrator plans to return to explore further, as the museum also holds the archive of Wood Green Empire, where their father worked on posters and programs. The proximity of this surprising area to recent riots in the High Street adds an unexpected contrast.

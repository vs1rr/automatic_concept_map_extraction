Bruce Castle in Tottenham is the second most famous building in the area after White Hart Lane Stadium. Its history dates back to the Norman Conquest, with the manor passing through various noble families before being renamed by Lord Coleraine in the 17th century. The house has never had a military function and was later used as a progressive school. Today, it serves as a museum showcasing Haringey's past and the legacy of Rowland Hill. Over the centuries, the castle underwent architectural changes to align with Georgian tastes. Despite alterations, the house retains its historical charm and continues to attract visitors.

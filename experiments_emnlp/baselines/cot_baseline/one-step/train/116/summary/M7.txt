Jacobean architecture, prevalent during the reigns of King James I and VI and Charles I in England, was a blend of Flemish, French, and Italian Renaissance influences with a focus on Flemish Mannerism elements like jewelled strapwork and grotesque ornamentation. It featured a mix of Orders, emblems, heraldic devices, and Dutch gables, while still incorporating Gothic elements such as mullioned windows. Notable examples include Hatfield House, Bramshill, and Audley End. Inigo Jones also made significant contributions during this period with his sophisticated Italian style. A Jacobean Revival occurred in the 19th century, blending with the Queen Anne style to create a unique hybrid architecture.

UKIP MEP Marta Andreasen is calling for the closure of the European Police College (Cepol) near Hook due to alleged misuse of EU funding, including buying furniture and mobile phones for staff members' private use. The college, which aims to educate policemen and promote good practice in fighting cross-border crime, has faced scrutiny over its spending practices, with the European Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee refusing to sign off on its accounts for 2008. Despite receiving 8 million euros annually from the EU, concerns about financial transparency persist, leading to calls for the college to be shut down.

Bramshill House and Gardens, dating back to the early 17th Century, is a significant Jacobean 'Prodigy' house with a rich history of architectural evolution and ownership changes. Originally built by Edward, 11th Baron Zouche of Harringworth, the house underwent various modifications over the centuries, including re-fronting, addition of pavilions, and alterations to the chapel. Surrounded by extensive grounds and a Grade II* listed park, the estate features historic landscape elements and tree avenues dating back to medieval times. The house served various purposes over the years, from a family residence to a maternity home during World War II, and later as a National Police Training College.

The "CSI Effect" refers to the influence of crime television shows on jurors, leading them to expect more forensic evidence in trials. This phenomenon can result in unrealistic demands for DNA tests, fingerprint analysis, and other procedures seen on TV. The increased reliance on forensic evidence can overwhelm crime laboratories and impact both prosecution and defense strategies. While forensic science is valuable, it is essential to consider all evidence in a case rather than relying solely on high-tech methods.

The CSI Syndrome, stemming from crime TV shows like CSI, distorts public perception of forensic science. The exaggerated portrayal of forensic techniques and the unrealistic abilities of TV investigators lead to skepticism from real investigators. This phenomenon also falsely elevates the importance of forensic evidence, potentially diminishing the value of confessions and circumstantial evidence. Moreover, there are concerns that these shows may inadvertently educate criminals on how to better hide evidence, complicating the work of real-life investigators.

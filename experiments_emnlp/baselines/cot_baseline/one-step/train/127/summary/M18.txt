Stone castles in Co. Tipperary originated in the 12th century to control the surrounding area, replacing earlier earth and timber structures with stone for defense. These castles, like Nenagh Castle, were costly to build, requiring many workers and materials. They served as offensive and defensive bases, centers of administration, and symbols of power. Castles were strategically located near essential features and were used by Norman invaders to maintain control. The introduction of gunpowder in the 14th century did not significantly impact castle construction until the 15th century when artillery became more powerful. By the 16th century, castles were replaced by artillery forts, and habitation shifted to more comfortable houses with limited fortifications.

Castles owned by the king and Anglo-Norman Lords were prominent, offering the best protection. Designs evolved over time, with Normans introducing advanced designs. Castles were strategically located for survival, with concentric castles becoming popular for their strong defenses. Early medieval castles were simpler, while later designs were more sophisticated. Castle entertainment kept inhabitants in good spirits. Castles were crucial for defense during sieges, requiring a large number of troops. Famous castles like Warwick and Windsor in England are well-preserved examples.

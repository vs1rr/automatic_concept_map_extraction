The text discusses the significant role played by Edward I's Welsh Castles in the period 1297-1413. These castles, built by Edward and his master mason James of St. George, had various functions including socio-economic, administrative, military, and propagandist roles. They were instrumental in incorporating Wales into English governance, attracting settlers, and symbolizing English power. Despite their massive investment and impressive construction, their military effectiveness was limited, and their importance in maintaining English rule in Wales was more about symbolism and propaganda. The castles also served as centers of legal enforcement and governmental outposts. Ultimately, the castles played a crucial role in enforcing English regal rights upon Wales and maintaining English supremacy, especially during the Glyn Dwr Revolt.

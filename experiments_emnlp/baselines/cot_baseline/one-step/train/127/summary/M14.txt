Concentric castles are characterized by having two or more curtain walls, with the outer wall lower than the inner one, creating a defense system where one wall can protect the other. These castles, like Krak des Chevaliers in Syria, were designed to withstand advances in siege technology, with features such as flanking towers for crossbows and platforms for trebuchets. The layout of concentric castles varied based on the terrain, with some having rectangular shapes like Belvoir or irregular polygons like Krak and Margat. The design likely originated in the Crusader states as a response to siege advancements. These castles were costly to build and maintain, making them accessible only to powerful military orders or kings. The concept of concentric defense was also seen in fortified cities and later fortifications, showing a continued influence on defensive architecture.

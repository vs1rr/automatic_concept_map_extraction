The evolution of castles in medieval Europe included the development of tower houses, built for political, economic, and defensive purposes. These structures served as homes, defensive fortresses, and administrative centers for kings and barons. Tower houses were simple yet effective in defense, with features like wall paintings and unique architectural elements. They were symbols of status and power, and were built across Europe, including in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Italy, and Central Europe. These tower houses varied in design and purpose, reflecting the social and political landscape of the time.

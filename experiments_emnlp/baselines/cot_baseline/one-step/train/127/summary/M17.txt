Medieval warfare during the Middle Ages was not just about battles in open fields, but often involved complex siegecraft. Castles were key symbols of power and strength, and besieging a castle required careful planning, including assembling an army, gathering supplies, and employing various tactics to overcome defenses. Siegecraft evolved over time, with the development of sophisticated siege engines like trebuchets and mangonels. Successful sieges often involved a combination of tactics, such as mining, using battering rams, and employing siege towers. Negotiation, bribery, and intimidation were also common ways to end a siege without bloodshed. The use of cannons in the late Middle Ages marked a shift in siege warfare, leading to the eventual decline of castles as military strongholds. Despite this, the conventions of siege warfare continued to influence military strategies for centuries to come.

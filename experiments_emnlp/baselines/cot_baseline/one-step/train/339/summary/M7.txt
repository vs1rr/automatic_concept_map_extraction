The text by Publius Huldah rebukes nullification deniers who claim that nullification by States of unconstitutional acts of the federal government is unlawful and impossible. The deniers, including individuals from organizations like the Heritage Foundation and the Human Events, make false assertions that contradict historical documents and the principles of the Founding Fathers. The text explains the conditions necessary for nullification, the concepts of interposition and nullification, and the importance of understanding the Founding Principles. It emphasizes that nullification is a natural right of self-defense, not a mere constitutional right, and that States have the authority to nullify unconstitutional federal acts. The text also addresses misconceptions about the role of the Supreme Court and the historical context of nullification, particularly during the Tariff Act of 1828 and the South Carolina Nullification Crisis. Ultimately, the text calls for a return to the principles of the Founding Fathers and a rejection of false assertions made by nullification deniers.

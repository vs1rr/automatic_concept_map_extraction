James Madison, born in 1751, was raised in privilege in Virginia, where he developed a passion for politics and intellectual pursuits. His career in politics began during the imperial crisis, leading to his involvement in the Virginia Convention of 1776 and the Continental Congress. Madison played a key role in shaping the Constitution and promoting its ratification. As a congressman, he championed individual rights and opposed Alexander Hamilton's financial plans, leading to the formation of political parties. Madison served as Secretary of State under Jefferson, overseeing foreign policy and the Louisiana Purchase. As president, he faced challenges with France and Great Britain, ultimately leading to the War of 1812. After his presidency, Madison continued to be active in public life, advocating for national bank recharter and constitutional amendments. He retired to Montpelier, engaging in farming and educational endeavors until his death in 1836.

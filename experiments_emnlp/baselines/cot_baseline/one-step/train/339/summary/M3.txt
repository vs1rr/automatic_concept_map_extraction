The text discusses the concept of interposition as a means for states to assert their sovereign powers in response to federal laws. It explains how proponents of nullification, like James Madison, rejected the idea of a single state nullifying national laws. Instead, Madison advocated for interposition, which involved public opinion, protests, petitions, and actions by state legislatures to ensure the government acted in accordance with the Constitution. The text highlights the importance of understanding the historical context and the theoretical foundation of the Federal Constitution in interpreting Madison's views on interposition. It also explores the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of the 1790s and the Nullification Crisis in the 1830s as examples of debates over federalism and constitutionalism. The text emphasizes the role of the people as the collective sovereign in monitoring the constitutional operation of the government and clarifies the distinction between interposition and nullification.

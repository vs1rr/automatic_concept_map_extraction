The Alien and Sedition Acts were a series of laws passed in 1798 by the Federalist-dominated Congress and signed by President John Adams. These acts aimed to restrict immigration, deport non-citizens, and criminalize criticism of the government. They were controversial, with critics arguing they violated freedom of speech. The acts were repealed after Thomas Jefferson's party came to power, but some provisions remain in effect today. The Sedition Act led to the prosecution of individuals critical of the government, including newspaper owners. The acts were a major issue in the 1800 election and ultimately contributed to the victory of the Democratic-Republicans. The Alien Enemies Act was used in World War II and continues to be relevant in the 21st century. The opposition to these acts led to the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, denouncing the federal legislation.

In 1833, a new convention was held in San Felipe, Texas, with a more aggressive approach than before. Only a quarter of the delegates from the previous gathering attended. The main focus was on drafting a constitution to be presented to the Mexican congress, with Stephen F. Austin chosen to deliver the petitions. Despite initial positive meetings with Mexican officials, Austin was later imprisoned without charges, returning to Texas just before the Texas Revolution in 1835.

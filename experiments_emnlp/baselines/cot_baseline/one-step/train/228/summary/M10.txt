The State of Coahuila y Tejas, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, established a constitutional tradition under the Mexican Constitution of 1824, influenced by the U.S. and Spanish constitutions. The state constitution of 1827 combined Texas with Coahuila, reflecting Spanish legal traditions like Catholicism as the state religion and community property laws. The constitution also introduced the homestead exemption from bankruptcy, providing stability for frontier families. Despite challenges and political unrest, the constitution addressed important needs of the time.

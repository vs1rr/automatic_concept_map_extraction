Texian Consultations at San Felipe in 1832 and 1833 were organized by colonists in Texas to address grievances and concerns to the Mexican government. The first Consultation in 1832 focused on issues like repealing laws restricting immigration and reducing tariffs, with delegates presenting memorials to the government. The second Consultation in 1833 saw debates on statehood within Mexico or independence, resulting in a proposed constitution and petitions for statehood and tariff relief. Despite efforts by figures like Stephen F. Austin, the Mexican government showed little response, leading to further calls for action and preparation for potential conflict.

San Felipe de Austin, founded in 1824 by Stephen F. Austin, served as the unofficial capital of his colony and played a significant role in early Texas history. The town thrived as a social, economic, and political center, with a growing population and important institutions like the colonial land office and the Texas Gazette newspaper. San Felipe de Austin was a hub for trade and communication, with a diverse population and notable residents. The town's involvement in the Texas Revolution culminated in its burning during the Runaway Scrape in 1836. Despite attempts at revival, San Felipe never fully recovered and eventually lost its status as the county seat. Today, the original townsite is preserved as a historical site, commemorating its important role in Texas history.

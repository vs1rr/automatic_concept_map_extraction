The Long Expedition in June 1819 aimed to conquer Texas, declaring it an independent Republic but was driven back by Spanish troops. Subsequent events included Mexican control, the Law of April 6, 1830, the Battle of Velasco, and the Convention of 1836 leading to the Declaration of Independence, the Battle of the Alamo, the Massacre at Goliad, and the Battle of San Jacinto, resulting in Texas winning independence and the birth of the Republic of Texas.

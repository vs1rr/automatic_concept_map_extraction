San Felipe de Austin served as the colonial capital of the Anglo colonies in Mexican Texas during the 1820s. Conventions in 1832 and 1833, led by figures like Stephen F. Austin, addressed grievances and proposed changes to the Mexican government. Despite efforts for separate statehood and other resolutions, these requests were never presented to Mexico. Austin's imprisonment in 1834 fueled support for an independent Texas, culminating in the Texas Revolution. The movement's roots were deeply tied to San Felipe de Austin, where a provisional state government was established during the revolution.

Mexico's migration policy for Texas was similar to that for California and New Mexico. US citizen Moses Austin acquired land in Texas in 1820, confirmed by Mexico in 1823. Stephen F. Austin sold land to settlers, attracting many due to affordable prices and fertile land. Mexico imposed restrictions on land ownership by foreigners, leading to tensions with Anglo settlers. Political turmoil in Mexico, including Santa Anna's rise to power, fueled unrest in Texas. The Alamo became a symbol of resistance, with a bloody battle resulting in Mexican victory. Santa Anna's harsh measures against Anglo rebels led to the Texas Declaration of Independence. Sam Houston's forces defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, leading to Santa Anna's capture and a pledge to end hostilities. Despite efforts to sell Texas to the US, it gained recognition as an independent state in 1837.

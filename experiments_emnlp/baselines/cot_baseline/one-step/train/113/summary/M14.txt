Borobudur is a Buddhist stupa and temple complex in Central Java, Indonesia, dating back to the 8th century. It is the largest Buddhist structure globally, with intricate construction details. The site, set in the lush Kedu Plain with active volcanoes in the backdrop, offers a sense of awe. The history of Borobudur is shrouded in mystery, with theories suggesting abandonment and rediscovery in the 19th century. Following restoration efforts, Borobudur was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991. The site attracts millions of visitors annually but faces challenges like vandalism and wear and tear. Borobudur also serves as a place of worship for Indonesian Buddhists. The 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi affected the site, leading to restoration efforts funded by UNESCO. Visitors can explore the intricate reliefs and statues at Borobudur, with guided tours available. The site also hosts festivals and events, making it a significant cultural and historical landmark in Indonesia.

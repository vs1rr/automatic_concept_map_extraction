A visit to a monastery introduced the author to Theravada Buddhism, where monks follow strict rules and study for a year before traveling to share their knowledge. The tour included statues representing stages of the Buddha's quest for Enlightenment. A meditation session followed, with guidance from a monk. The day continued with a visit to Borobudur Temple, a Mahayana Buddhist temple from the 9th Century, showcasing different levels symbolizing the path to enlightenment. The temple, rediscovered in 1814, was restored by UNESCO and the Indonesian government. The contrast between the serene monastery and the bustling temple provided a unique insight into the same religion in different settings.

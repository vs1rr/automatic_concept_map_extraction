The text discusses two Indonesian World Heritage Sites: Borobudur Temple Compounds and Komodo National Park. Borobudur, built by the Syailendra Dynasty, is an ancient Buddhist temple complex in Central Java, known for its art and architecture. The site faces threats from development and tourism, requiring management efforts for sustainability. On the other hand, Komodo National Park, home to the Komodo Dragon, is a conservation area facing challenges such as balancing tourism and conservation, and managing marine resources. Both sites use strategies like community involvement, celebrity endorsements, and UNESCO recognition for marketing and preservation.

The Borobudur Temple Compound in Indonesia is a significant ancient Buddhist monument, showcasing the country's pre-Islamic history dominated by Hinduism and Buddhism. Built in the 8th and 9th centuries, this monumental temple was abandoned by the 16th century but later restored in an ambitious preservation project. Despite threats like volcanic eruptions, efforts continue to protect and conserve this cultural and historical icon, demonstrating its enduring value in a predominantly Muslim country.

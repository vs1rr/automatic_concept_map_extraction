The Pendle Witch trials in 1612 involved twelve accused individuals from the Pendle Hill area in Lancashire, charged with using witchcraft to murder ten people. Most were tried at Lancaster Assizes, resulting in ten executions. The trials, documented in "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster," were unusual for England at the time. The accused came from two families, with disputes possibly fueled by competition for livelihoods involving healing and extortion.

Artist Joe Hesketh delves into the horrors of the Pendle Witch Trials through his art, drawing inspiration from his childhood in Pendle where he felt akin to the witches. He aims to shed light on the injustice faced by the accused, who were misunderstood healers rather than evil magicians. By immersing himself in the story through a four-day walk along the Purgatory Trail, Hesketh seeks to truly understand and convey the trials' impact. Despite societal changes, echoes of the past still linger in modern-day Pendle, where cultural differences are not always embraced. Through his work, Hesketh hopes to educate and provoke thought, bringing a contemporary perspective to a dark chapter in history.

Pedro I and Pedro II played crucial roles in shaping Brazil's history in the 19th century. The events in Europe, particularly Napoleon's conquests, led to the Portuguese royal court fleeing to Rio de Janeiro in 1808. Pedro I's declaration of independence from Portugal in 1822 marked a turning point, supported by public opinion and leading to the establishment of the Empire of Brazil. The transition to an empire, symbolized by Pedro I's coronation, reflected a deliberate political move to establish legitimacy and divine support. The comparison of King Jo√£o VI and Emperor Pedro I's portraits highlights their different political positions. Debret's paintings capture key moments in Brazilian history, showcasing the monarchy's significance and the societal structure of Rio de Janeiro. Pedro II's assumption of power as a child and subsequent rule for nearly six decades underscored the elites' support for the monarchy. The illustrations and historical accounts provide insights into Brazil's journey towards independence and the establishment of its imperial identity.

The Brazilian Empire, spanning from 1822 to 1889, was a stable state under the rule of Dom Pedro I and Dom Pedro II. It engaged in various wars, expanding its borders and supporting allies in conflicts. The empire was characterized by political stability, economic growth, and democratic institutions, though rights were limited for women and slaves. After a series of wars and the abolition of slavery in 1888, the empire transitioned into a republic in 1889 following a bloodless coup.

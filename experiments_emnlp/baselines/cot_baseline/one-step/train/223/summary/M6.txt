The Byzantine Empire faced threats from surrounding enemies like the Bulgarian and Serbian Empires, as well as the advancing Turks who transformed Anatolia into an Islamic land. To receive aid against the Turks, the Byzantines reluctantly converted to Catholicism, causing unrest among the Orthodox populace. Despite their efforts, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire and the beginning of the Ottoman Empire.

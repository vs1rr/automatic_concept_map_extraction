In 1453, the siege of Constantinople by Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Turks led to the fall of the heavily fortified city, defended by a small Byzantine force against a much larger Turkish army. The Turks used advanced war tactics, including cannons, warships, and infantry assaults, to breach the walls and eventually conquer the city. Despite valiant efforts by the defenders, Constantinople fell, leading to its renaming as Istanbul and the establishment of new rules under Islamic rule.

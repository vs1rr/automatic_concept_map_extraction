The Book of Kells is not just a religious manuscript, but a masterpiece of Celtic art from ancient Ireland. Originally created to hold the four gospels, its intricate design and age make it a treasure of Western Europe. The book's origins are uncertain, but it was moved to Kells Monastery in Ireland for protection during Viking raids. Despite being stolen and damaged, it was later returned to Trinity College of Dublin, where it remains today. The book's intricate artwork, taking thirty years to complete, showcases various styles and meticulous detail, with no symbol repeated. Its pages depict events in the life of Christ and saints, with such precision that it was once believed only angels could have created it.

The Book of Kells, a renowned illuminated manuscript created over 1,200 years ago in medieval Ireland, is now safeguarded at Trinity College Library in Dublin. This replica, housed at the Hackley Public Library, was made available through a fundraising campaign. The facsimile edition is displayed in a special case, with donors' names listed. It is believed to be the only facsimile of the Book of Kells permanently exhibited in a North American public library. Visitors can explore the book through a video and a detailed commentary volume available at the library.

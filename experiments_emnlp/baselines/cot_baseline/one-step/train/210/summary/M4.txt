Ancient Egypt, one of the greatest civilizations in history, thrived along the Nile River for over 3000 years. The Nile provided wealth through irrigation, food, and transportation. The civilization is divided into three major kingdoms with rich culture in government, religion, arts, and writing. Pharaohs were buried in pyramids with treasures for the afterlife. The empire weakened and was conquered by various civilizations, including the Romans. Ancient Egyptians were pioneers in makeup, writing, and inventions like the calendar and toothpaste. They played a significant role in the Bible, and cats were considered sacred.

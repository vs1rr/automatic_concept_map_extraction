Ancient Egypt's roots date back over 6,000 years to the Nile River settlement. The unification of Upper and Lower Egypt marked the beginning of the Pharaonic Age, with power centralized under a god-king. The Egyptians were pioneers in various fields, such as belief in life after death, stone architecture, and writing. The Nile's annual flood cycle influenced their beliefs and agricultural practices. The Old and Middle Kingdoms saw the peak of Egyptian civilization, with divine kingship and pyramid building defining the era. The New Kingdom brought military expansion and temple construction, culminating in Akhenaten's monotheism. The Late Period faced challenges from external civilizations but maintained a centralized state until Persian occupation. Egypt regained independence briefly before falling under Persian rule once more.

The Ramesside Period was a time of prosperity and stability due to the succession of kings from one family. The reformation under the Amen cult involved destroying statues from the Amarna Period, emphasizing traditional beliefs. Kings like Rameses II extended royal tombs, showing respect for customs. The elaborate tombs for the royal family, including queens like Nefertari, reflected the importance of family and the afterlife. Scenes in tombs depicted close kinship and the value of life on earth. Workers in Deir el-Medina documented their activities and thoughts, providing insight into the period's culture.

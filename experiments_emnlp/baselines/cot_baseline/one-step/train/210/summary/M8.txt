Ancient Egypt, spanning the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, has left a lasting impact on Western traditions in art, architecture, and religion. Each kingdom saw changes in these aspects, influenced by internal forces and outside factors. The Old Kingdom, with pharaohs like Zoser, built the first pyramids, while the Middle Kingdom introduced the myth of Osiris and intricate jewelry. The New Kingdom brought the Valley of the Kings and a shift towards monotheism under Akhenaton. Despite internal struggles and eventual conquest, the legacy of ancient Egypt continues to shape modern beliefs and culture.

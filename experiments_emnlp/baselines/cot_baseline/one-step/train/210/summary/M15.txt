The Roman province of Egypt, known as Aegyptus, was established in 30 BC under Augustus after defeating Mark Anthony and Cleopatra. The capital was Alexandria, and the province was governed by a hierarchy with a governor at the top. Egypt was divided into small provinces for administration, and a complex tax system was developed by the Romans. Social hierarchy was introduced, and citizenship could be obtained through military service. Egypt was a vital source of food for Rome, and trade flourished in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Christianity spread in Egypt, with Alexandria becoming a major center. After the Roman Empire split, Egypt became part of the Byzantine Empire, with Greek remaining the dominant language.

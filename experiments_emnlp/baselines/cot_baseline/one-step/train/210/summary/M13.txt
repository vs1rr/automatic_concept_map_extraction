The Late Period of Ancient Egypt marked the decline of Egyptian power, with native rulers reigning between the Third Intermediate Period and the Persian conquests. The Twenty-Sixth Dynasty, also known as the Saite Period, was followed by the First Persian Occupation during the Twenty-Seventh Dynasty. The Twenty-Eighth to Thirtieth Dynasties saw a rebellion against the Persians by King Amyrtaeus, while the Thirtieth Dynasty's defeat led to re-occupation. The Thirty-First Dynasty, known as the Achaemenid Dynasty, experienced a Second Persian Occupation. References provide further insight into this historical period.

Brougham Castle, located near Penrith in Cumbria, England, was built in the 13th century on the site of a Roman fort. The castle features a keep with a hall and lord's chamber, where Lady Anne stayed and eventually passed away. Overlooking the River Eamont, the castle offers panoramic views of the surrounding area. Initially constructed by Robert de Vieuxpont, it later came under the ownership of the Clifford family. Despite being damaged by the Scots in 1388 and falling into disrepair during the English Civil War, Lady Anne Clifford restored the castle in 1643. Following her death in 1676, the castle was left to ruin under the ownership of the Earls of Thanet. Today, Brougham Castle is under the care of English Heritage and is open to the public.

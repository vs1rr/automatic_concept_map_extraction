Brougham Castle in Cumbria, built in 1214 by Robert de Vieuxpont on a Roman fort site, features a surviving great tower and stone curtain wall added by Robert Clifford in 1300. The castle played a crucial role in Anglo-Scottish wars and the Wars of the Roses. Over time, its military significance waned, leading to periods of neglect. Lady Anne Clifford, who inherited it in 1643, once called it home. Today, visitors can explore the site with an introductory exhibition and view carved stones from the nearby Roman fort. Accommodation options near Brougham Castle include hotels, guesthouses, and bed and breakfasts.

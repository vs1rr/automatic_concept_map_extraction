Brougham Castle in Cumbria, built in the early 13th Century by Robert de Vieuxpont, is strategically located between the rivers Lowther and Eamont. Initially a stone keep and bailey, it was later improved with stone defenses and a new gatehouse. The castle passed through the de Vieuxpont and de Clifford families, witnessing conflicts and improvements over the centuries. By the 17th Century, it fell into disrepair until Lady Anne Clifford undertook a restoration. Eventually, the castle came into state ownership in the 1930s and is now managed by English Heritage, open to the public.

Brough Castle, located near the A66 in Brough, is a historic site dating back to 1090, built on the remains of a Roman fort called Verteris. Initially constructed by William Rufus as a defense against the Scots, the castle saw various sieges and changes of ownership over the centuries. The Clifford family added significant structures to the castle until a fire in 1521 left it in ruins. Lady Anne Clifford initiated restoration works in the 17th century, but the castle eventually fell into disrepair. In 1920, it was taken over by the Ministry of Works and is now maintained by English Heritage. Visitors can explore the castle for free, and its location is easily accessible by road, train, or bus.

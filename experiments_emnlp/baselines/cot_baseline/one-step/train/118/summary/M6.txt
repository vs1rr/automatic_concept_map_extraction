Brougham Castle, located near Penrith, was originally a Roman fort before being taken over by the Norman family of Vieuxpont to build a castle. Over the years, it passed through different owners, including Robert Clifford who strengthened its defenses during the Scottish wars. Lady Anne Clifford inherited the castle in 1643 and spent years restoring it and other castles in the area. The castle eventually fell into ruin after her death in 1676. Visitors can explore the impressive ruins, including the oldest part - the keep, with its various rooms and views of the surrounding area. The castle is now under the care of English Heritage, offering a shop, exhibitions, and a guidebook detailing its history.

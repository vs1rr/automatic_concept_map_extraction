Year 10 History trip to Brougham Castle on May 21st was a sunny day for the annual visit. The castle, built in 1203 by the Norman family of Vieuxpont near Penrith, Cumbria, featured a stone keep and timber palisade. It played a crucial role in the Scottish wars, hosting important figures like Robert Clifford and King Edward I. The 103 GCSE historians on the trip showed exemplary attitude and behavior, diligently preparing for their upcoming Controlled Assessments. Ms. Lomas commended their hard work and pleasant company.

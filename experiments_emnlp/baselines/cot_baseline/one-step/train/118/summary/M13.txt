Brougham Castle, built around 1214 by Robert de Vieuxpont to defend against King John's enemies, was strategically located near rivers and roads. Over the years, various improvements were made by the Cliffords to strengthen the castle against Scottish attacks during the Anglo-Scottish wars. Despite being captured and sacked in 1388, the castle saw some activity in 1421 when a man was accused of forging coins within its walls.

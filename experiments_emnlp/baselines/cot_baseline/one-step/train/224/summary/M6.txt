Rumors of gold in California had circulated for years before the Gold Rush, but it was the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill that sparked the frenzy. John Sutter, a Swiss emigrant, established Sutter's Fort in Sacramento Valley, where he developed various businesses. In 1847, he hired James Marshall to build a sawmill at Coloma, where gold was discovered in 1848. Despite Sutter's efforts to keep the find a secret, news spread rapidly, reaching President James Polk by December 1848, making the discovery of gold in California a national sensation.

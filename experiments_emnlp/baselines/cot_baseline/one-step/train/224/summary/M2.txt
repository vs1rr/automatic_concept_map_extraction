The California Gold Rush began in 1848 when gold was discovered at Sutter's Lumber Mill in Coloma, California, attracting 300,000 prospectors known as "forty-niners" seeking instant wealth. The discovery occurred before California was formally ceded to the United States in 1848. The rush led to a significant economic boom, with $80 million in gold extracted in 1852. Various locations like Mormon Island and Bidwell's Bar saw gold strikes, contributing to the frenzy.

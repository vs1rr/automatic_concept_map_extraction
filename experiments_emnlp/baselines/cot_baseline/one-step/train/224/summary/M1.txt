The Gold Rush of 1849 was sparked by the discovery of gold nuggets in the Sacramento Valley, leading to a massive influx of prospectors to California. The population surged from less than 1,000 to 100,000 by the end of 1849, with $2 billion worth of gold extracted. The discovery at Sutter's Mill by James Wilson Marshall in 1848 marked the beginning of this historic event.

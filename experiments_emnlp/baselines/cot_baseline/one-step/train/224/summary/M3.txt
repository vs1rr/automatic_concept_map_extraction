The California Gold Rush was a period of mass hysteria and migration to Northern California after the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848. Despite many seeking fortune, most only made enough to cover daily expenses. The rush led to significant development in California, with San Francisco initially becoming a ghost town before booming with returning miners. The influx strained infrastructure and led to vigilante groups forming due to rising crime. The Gold Rush ended in 1858 with the start of the New Mexican Gold Rush, and the San Francisco 49ers NFL team is named after the prospectors of this era.

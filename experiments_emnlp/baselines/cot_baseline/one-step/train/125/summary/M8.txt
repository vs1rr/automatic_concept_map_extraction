Old Pine Church, also known as Mill Church and Nicholas Church, is a mid-19th century church in West Virginia. Initially serving as a nondenominational "union church," it later became affiliated with the Brethren denomination. The church and its cemetery were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012 due to their significant rural religious architecture. The church's interior features original elements like pews from 1857, while the cemetery contains gravestones dating back to 1834. Old Pine Church continues to be used for community events and burials, maintaining its historical significance.

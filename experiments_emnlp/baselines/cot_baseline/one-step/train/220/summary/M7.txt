The British Empire originated in the late 16th century through private commercial ventures chartered by the crown, establishing trading posts in India, the East Indies, Newfoundland, and Hudson Bay. The empire expanded with the growth of plantations in the Caribbean and North America, attracting European settlers and relying on the African slave trade for cheap labor. The Navigation Acts were passed to ensure imperial self-sufficiency and increase British wealth. By the late 17th and early 18th centuries, British encroachment on Spanish and Dutch territories and rivalry with France in India, Canada, and Africa led to greater direct control over the expanding empire. The British East India Company's victory over its French counterpart in India and the Treaty of Paris in 1763 firmly established British presence in India and Canada. The financial strain of war with the American colonies eventually led to the end of the first British Empire after the success of the American Revolution.

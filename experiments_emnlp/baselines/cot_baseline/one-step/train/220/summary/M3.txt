A protectorate is a dependent territory granted local autonomy by a greater sovereign state while retaining suzerainty. Protectorates differ from colonies as they have local rulers and limited immigration. Protectorates may have favorable terms, and in modern times, they are seen in microstates. Protectorates have limited foreign relations and rely on the protecting power for defense. Examples include British protectorates like Zanzibar and Solomon Islands. Other countries like France and Italy also had protectorates in various regions. The United States still uses the term for insular areas like Guam and Puerto Rico. Joint protectorates, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, have also existed historically.
